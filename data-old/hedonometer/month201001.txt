Well  I learned a lot of things about ballooning  especially at the end of these balloon flights around the world I did with Brian Jones. When I took this picture  the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night. And on the other side there was a rising sun. So  you see that on the other side of ice you have the unknown  you have the non obvious  you have the non seen  for the people who don't dare to go through the ice. There are so many people who prefer to suffer in the ice they know instead of taking the risk of going through the ice to see what there is on the other side. And I think that's one of the main problems of our society. We learn  maybe not the famous TED audience  but so many other people learn  that the unknown  the doubts  the question marks are dangerous. And we have to resist to the changes. We have to keep everything under control. Well  the unknown is part of life. And in that sense  ballooning is a beautiful metaphor. Because in the balloon  like in life  we go very well in unforeseen directions. We want to go in a direction  but the winds push us in another direction  like in life. And as long as we fight horizontally  against life  against the winds  against what's happening to us  life is a nightmare. How do we steer a balloon  By understanding that the atmosphere is made out of several different layers of wind which all have different direction. So  then  we understand that if we want to change our trajectory  in life  or in the balloon  we have to change altitude. Changing altitude  in life  that means raising to another psychological  philosophical  spiritual level. But how do we do that  In ballooning  or in life  how do we change altitude  How do we go from the metaphor to something more practical that we can really use every day  Well  in a balloon it's easy  we have ballast. And when we drop the ballast overboard we climb. Sand  water  all the equipment we don't need anymore. And I think in life it should be exactly like this. You know  when people speak about pioneering spirit  very often they believe that pioneers are the ones who have new ideas. It's not true. The pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas  because new ideas are so easy to have. We just close our eyes for a minute we all come back with a lot of new ideas. No  the pioneer is the one who allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast. Habits  certainties  convictions  exclamation marks  paradigms  dogmas. And when we are able to do that  what happens  Life is not anymore just one line going in one direction in one dimension. No. Life is going to be made out of all the possible lines that go in all the possible directions in three dimensions. And pioneering spirit will be each time we allow ourselves to explore this vertical axis. Of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon  but in life itself. Explore this vertical axis  that means explore all the different ways to do  all the different ways to behave  all the different ways to think  before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish. This is very practical. This can be in politics. This can be in spirituality. This can be in environment  in finance  in education of children. I deeply believe that life is a much greater adventure if we manage to do politics without the trench between the left and the right wing. Because we will throw away these political dogmas. I deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment if we get rid    if we throw overboard this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past. And that we can aim for much higher spirituality if we get rid of the religious dogmas. Throwing overboard  as ballast  to change our direction. Well  these basically are things I believed in such a long time. But actually I had to go around the world in a balloon to be invited to talk about it. It's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop and which altitude to take. Sometime we need friends  family members or a psychiatrist. Well  in balloons we need weather men  the one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind  at which altitude  in order to help the balloonist. But sometimes it's very paradoxical. When Brian Jones and I were flying around the world  the weather man asked us  one day  to fly quite low  and very slow. And when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it around the world at that speed. So  we disobeyed. We flew much higher  and double the speed. And I was so proud to have found that jetstream that I called the weather man  and I told him   Hey  guy  don't you think we're good pilots up there  We fly twice the speed you predicted.  And he told me   Don't do that. Go down immediately in order to slow down.  And I started to argue. I said   I'm not going to do that. We don't have enough gas to fly so slow.  And he told me   Yes  but with the low pressure you have on your left if you fly too fast  in a couple of hours you will turn left and end up at the North Pole. And then he asked me    and this is something I will never forget in my life    he just asked me   You're the good pilot up there. What do you really want  You want to go very fast in the wrong direction  or slowly in the good direction  And this is why you need weathermen. This is why you need people with long term vision. And this is precisely what fails in the political visions we have now  in the political governments. We are burning  as you heard  so much energy  not understanding that such an unsustainable way of life cannot last for long. So  we went down actually. We slowed down. And we went through moments of fears because we had no idea how the little amount of gas we had in the balloon could allow us to travel        kilometers. But we were expected to have doubts  we're expected to have fears. And actually this is where the adventure really started. When we were flying over the Sahara and India it was nice holidays. We could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane. In the middle of the Pacific  when you don't have the good winds  you cannot land  you cannot go back. That's a crisis. That's the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking. That's the moment when you have to motivate your inner potential  your creativity. That's when you throw out all the ballast  all the certainties  in order to adapt to the new situation. And actually  we changed completely our flight plan. We changed completely our strategy. And after    days we landed successfully in Egypt. But if I show you this picture it's not to tell you how happy we were. It's to show you how much gas was left in the last bottles. We took off with  .  tons of liquid propane. We landed with    kilos. When I saw that  I made a promise to myself. I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world  it would be with no fuel  independent from fossil energies  in order to be safe  not to be threatened by the fuel gauge. I had no idea how it was possible. I just thought it's a dream and I want to do it. And when the capsule of my balloon was introduced officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington  together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh  with Apollo     with the Wright Brothers' Flyer  with Chuck Yeager's     I had really a thought then. I thought  well  the   th century  that was brilliant. It allowed to do all those things there. But it will not be possible in the future any more. It takes too much energy. It will cost too much. It will be prohibited because we'll have to save our natural resources in a few decades from now. So how can we perpetuate this pioneering spirit with something that will be independent from fossil energy  And this is when the project Solar Impulse really started to turn in my head. And I think it's a nice metaphor also for the   st century. Pioneering spirit should continue  but on another level. Not to conquer the planet or space  not anymore  it has been done  but rather to improve the quality of life. How can we go through the ice of certainty in order to make the most incredible a possible thing  What is today completely impossible    get rid of our dependency on fossil energy. If you tell to people  we want to be independent from fossil energy in our world  people will laugh at you  except here  where crazy people are invited to speak. So  the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar powered airplane  using absolutely no fuel  nobody ever could say in the future that it's impossible to do it for cars  for heating systems  for computers  and so on and so on. Well  solar power airplanes are not new. They have flown in the past  but without saving capabilities  without batteries. Which means that they have more proven the limits of renewable energies than the potential of it. If we want to show the potential  we have to fly day and night. That means to load the batteries during the flight  in order to spend the night on the batteries  and fly the next day again. It has been made  already  on remote controlled little airplane models  without pilots. But it stays an anecdote because the public couldn't identify to it. I think you need a pilot in the plane that can talk to the universities  that can talk to students  talk to politicians during the flight  and really make it a human adventure. For that  unfortunately  four meters wingspan is not enough. You need    meter wingspan.    meter wingspan to carry one pilot  the batteries  flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency. Why that  Because fuel is not easy to replace. That's for sure. And with     square meters of solar power on our plane  we can produce the same energy than     little lightbulbs. That means a Christmas tree  a big Christmas tree. So the question is  how can you carry a pilot around the world with an airplane that uses the same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree  People will tell you it's impossible  and that's exactly why we try to do it. We launched the project with my colleague Andre Borschberg six years ago. We have now    people in the team working on it. We have gone through the stages of simulation  design  computing  preparing the construction of the first prototype. That has been achieved after two years of work. Cockpit  propeller  engine. Just the fuselage here  it's so light. It's not designed by an artist  but it could be.    kilos for the entire fuselage. Couple of kilos more for the wing spars. This is the complete structure of the airplane. And one month ago we have unveiled it. You cannot imagine how it is for a team who has been working six years on it to show that it's not only a dream and a vision  it's a real airplane. A real airplane that we could finally present. And what's the goal now  The goal is to take off  end of this year for the first test  but mainly next year  spring or summer  take off  on our own power  without additional help  without being towed  climb to       meters altitude. The same time we load the batteries  we run the engines  and when we get at the maximum height  we arrive at the beginning of the night. And there  there will be just one goal  just one  reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty. And this is exactly the symbol of our world. If our airplane is too heavy  if the pilot wastes energy  we'll never make it through the night. And in our world  if we keep on spoiling  wasting our energy resources  if we keep on building things that consume so much energy that most of the companies now go bankrupt  it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation without a major problem. So  you see that this airplane is more a symbol. I don't think it will transport     people in the next years. But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic  the payload was also just sufficient for one person and some fuel. And    years later there were     people in every airplane crossing the Atlantic. So  we have to start  and show the example. A little bit like on this picture here. This is a painting from Magritte  in the museum in Holland that I love so much. It's a pipe  and it's written   This is not a pipe.  This is not an airplane. This is a symbol of what we can achieve when we believe in the impossible  when we have a team  when we have pioneering spirit  and especially when we understand that all the certainties we have should be thrown overboard. What pleases me very much is that in the beginning I thought that we would have to fly around the world with no fuel in order to have our message been understood. And more and more  we're invited around the world with Andre to talk about that project  to talk about the symbol of it  invited by politicians  invited in energy forums  in order to show that it's not anymore completely stupid to think about getting rid of the dependency on fossil energies. So  through speeches like this one today  through interviews  through meetings  our goal is to get as many people possible on the team. The success will not come if we  just   quote  unquote  fly around the world in a solar powered airplane. No  the success will come if enough people are motivated to do exactly the same in their daily life  save energy  go to renewables. And this is possible. You know  with the technologies we have today  we can save between    and    percent of the energy of a country in Europe  and we can solve half of the rest with renewables. It leaves    or    percent for oil  gas  coal  nuclear  or whatever. This is acceptable. This is why all the people who believe in this type of spirit are welcome to be on that team. You can just go on SolarImpulse.com  subscribe to just be informed of what we're doing. But much more  to get advices  to give your comments  to spread the word that if it's possible in the air  of course it's possible in the ground. And each time we have some ice in the future  we have to know that life will be great  and the success will be brilliant if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice  to go through the obstacle  to go through the problem  in order to see what there is on the other side. So  you see  this is what we're doing on our side. Everyone has his goal  has his dreams  has his visions. The question I leave you with now is which is the ballast you would like to throw overboard  Which will be the altitude at which you would like to fly in your life  to get to the success that you wish to have  to get to the point that really belongs to you  with the potential you have  and the one you can really fulfill  Because the most renewable energy we have is our own potential  and our own passion. So  let's go for it  and I wish you an excellent adventure in the wings of the future. Thank you. I'd like to talk to you today about the human brain  which is what we do research on at the University of California. Just think about this problem for a second. Here is a lump of flesh  about three pounds  which you can hold in the palm of your hand. But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space. It can contemplate the meaning of infinity  ask questions about the meaning of its own existence  about the nature of God. And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world. It's the greatest mystery confronting human beings  How does this all come about  Well  the brain  as you know  is made up of neurons. We're looking at neurons here. There are     billion neurons in the adult human brain. And each neuron makes something like       to        contacts with other neurons in the brain. And based on this  people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe. So  how do you go about studying the brain  One approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain  and study changes in their behavior. This is what I spoke about in the last TED. Today I'll talk about a different approach  which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain  and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain. Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain. Now  one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in Italy  in Parma  by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues  is a group of neurons called mirror neurons  which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes. Now  it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain  which have been known for over    years. These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action. For example  if I do that  and reach and grab an apple  a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire. If I reach out and pull an object  another neuron will fire  commanding me to pull that object. These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time. But what Rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons  maybe about    percent of them  will also fire when I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action. So  here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something  but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something. And this is truly astonishing. Because it's as though this neuron is adopting the other person's point of view. It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person's action. Now  what is the significance of these mirror neurons  For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation. Because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person's point of view. So  this is important for imitation and emulation. Well  why is that important  Well  let's take a look at the next slide. So  how do you do imitation  Why is imitation important  Mirror neurons and imitation  emulation. Now  let's look at culture  the phenomenon of human culture. If you go back in time about          to         years ago  let's look at human evolution  it turns out that something very important happened around        years ago. And that is  there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use  the use of fire  the use of shelters  and  of course  language  and the ability to read somebody else's mind and interpret that person's behavior. All of that happened relatively quickly. Even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago          years ago all of this happened very  very quickly. And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system  which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions. So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group  say the use of fire  or a particular type of tool  instead of dying out  this spread rapidly  horizontally across the population  or was transmitted vertically  down the generations. So  this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian  instead of Darwinian. Darwinian evolution is slow  it takes hundreds of thousands of years. A polar bear  to evolve a coat  will take thousands of generations  maybe         years. A human being  a child  can just watch its parent kill another polar bear  and skin it and put the skin on its body  fur on the body  and learn it in one step. What the polar bear took         years to learn  it can learn in five minutes  maybe    minutes. And then once it's learned this it spreads in geometric proportion across a population. This is the basis. The imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization. Now there is another kind of mirror neuron  which is involved in something quite different. And that is  there are mirror neurons  just as there are mirror neurons for action  there are mirror neurons for touch. In other words  if somebody touches me  my hand  neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires. But the same neuron  in some cases  will fire when I simply watch another person being touched. So  it's empathizing the other person being touched. So  most of them will fire when I'm touched in different locations. Different neurons for different locations. But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location. So  here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy. Now  the question then arises  If I simply watch another person being touched  why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched  I mean  I empathize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch. Well  that's because you've got receptors in your skin  touch and pain receptors  going back into your brain and saying  Don't worry  you're not being touched. So  empathize  by all means  with the other person  but do not actually experience the touch  otherwise you'll get confused and muddled.  Okay  so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch. But if you remove the arm  you simply anesthetize my arm  so you put an injection into my arm  anesthetize the brachial plexus  so the arm is numb  and there is no sensations coming in  if I now watch you being touched  I literally feel it in my hand. In other words  you have dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings. So  I call them Gandhi neurons  or empathy neurons. And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense. All that's separating you from him  from the other person  is your skin. Remove the skin  you experience that person's touch in your mind. You've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings. And this  of course  is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy  and that is there is no real independent self  aloof from other human beings  inspecting the world  inspecting other people. You are  in fact  connected not just via Facebook and Internet  you're actually quite literally connected by your neurons. And there is whole chains of neurons around this room  talking to each other. And there is no real distinctiveness of your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness. And this is not mumbo jumbo philosophy. It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience. So  you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed and you have a phantom  and you watch somebody else being touched  you feel it in your phantom. Now the astonishing thing is  if you have pain in your phantom limb  you squeeze the other person's hand  massage the other person's hand  that relieves the pain in your phantom hand  almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged. So  here you have my last slide. For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct. C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures  science on the one hand  humanities on the other  never the twain shall meet. So  I'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness  representation of self  what separates you from other human beings  what allows you to empathize with other human beings  and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization  which is unique to human beings. Thank you. So      years ago  Dr. R ntgen X rayed his wife's hand. Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor with her brooch  I'm not sure. It seems a bit extreme to me. That image was the start of the X ray technology. And I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today. I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner. The first shot I ever did was of a soda can  which was to promote a brand that we all know  so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it. But the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day. And I do really like this shot  because it shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded in the sole of the sneakers. It was just one of those pot luck things where you get it right first time. Moving on to something a bit larger  this is an X ray of a bus. And the bus is full of people. It's actually the same person. It's just one skeleton. And back in the '  s  they used to teach student radiographers to take X rays  thankfully not on you and I  but on dead people. So  I've still got access to one of these dead people called Frieda  she's falling apart  I'm afraid  because she's very old and fragile. But everyone on that bus is Frieda. And the bus is taken with a cargo scanning X ray  which is the sort of machine you have on borders  which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things. Fairly obvious what that is. So  using large scale objects does sort of create drama because you just don't see X rays of big things that often. Technology is moving ahead  and these large cargo scanner X rays that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better. Again though  to make it come alive you need  somehow  to add the human element. And I think the reason this image works  again  is because Frieda is driving the bulldozer. Quite a difficult brief  make a pair of men's pants look beautiful. But I think the process  in itself  shows how exquisite they are. Fashion    now  I'm sort of anti fashion because I don't show the surface  I show what's within. So  the fashionistas don't really like me because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it  it looks the same. We all look the same inside  believe me. The creases in the material and the sort of nuances. And I show things for really what they are  what they're made of. I peel back the layers and expose it. And if it's well made I show it  if it's badly made I show it. And I'm sure Ross can associate that with design. The design comes from within. It's not just Topshop  I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props. Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department of a department store  almost got escorted from the premises. I live opposite a farm. And this was the runt of the litter  a piglet that died. And what's really interesting is  if you look at the legs  you'll notice that the bones haven't fused. And should that pig have grown  unfortunately it was dead  it would have certainly been dead after I X rayed it  with the amount of radiation I used anyway. But once the bones had fused together it would have been healthy. So  that's an empty parka jacket. But I quite love the way it's posed. Nature is my greatest inspiration. And to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with is how nature is related to architecture. If you look at the roof of the Eden Project  or the British library  it's all this honeycomb structure. And I'm sure those architects are inspired  as I am  by what surrounds us  by nature. This  in fact  is a Victoria water lily leaf that floats on the top of a pond. An amaryllis flower looking really three dimensional. Seaweed  ebbing in the tide. Now  how do I do this  and where do I do this  and all of that sort of thing. This is my new  purpose built  X ray shed. And the door to my X ray room is made of lead and steel. It weighs       kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it. The walls are     millimeters thick of solid dense concrete. So  I'm using quite a lot of radiation. A lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's. And there I am. This is a quite high powered X ray machine. What's interesting really about X ray really is  if you think about it  is that that technology is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs  or looking for contraband or whatever. And I use that sort of technology to create things that are quite beautiful. So  still working with film  I'm afraid. Technology in X ray where it's life size processed  apart from these large cargo scanning machines  hasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image and the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it  which is show my pictures big. So  I have to use a     s drum scanner  which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film. They scan each individual X ray. And this shows how I do my process of same size X rays. So  this is  again  my daughter's dress. Still has the tag in it from me buying it  so I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it. But there are four X ray plates. You can see them overlapping. So  when you move forward from something fairly small  a dress which is this size  onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process  you can see that that is a lot of work. In fact  that is three months solid X raying. There is over     separate components. Boeing sent me a     in containers. And I sent them back an X ray. Okay  so Frieda is my dead skeleton. This  unfortunately  is basically two pictures. One on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer. The one on the left is an x ray. But this time I had to use a real body. Because I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real  to make it look like it was a real athlete. So  here I had to use a recently deceased body. And getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious. But people do donate their bodies to art and science. And when they do  I'm in the queue. So  I like to use them. The coloring  so coloring adds another level to the X rays. It makes it more organic  more natural. It's whatever takes my fancy  really. It's not accurately colored to how it is in real life. That flower doesn't come in bright orange  I don't think. But I just like it in bright orange. And also with something technical  like these are DJ decks  it sort of adds another level. It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional. The most difficult things to X ray  the most technically challenging things to X ray are the lightest things  the most delicate things. To get the detail in a feather  believe me  if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X rays  that's quite a challenge. I'm now going to show you a short film  I'll step to the side. Video   Music  The thing in there is very dangerous. If you touch that  you could possibly die through radiation poisoning. In my career I've had two exposures to radiation  which is two too many  because it stays with you for life. It's cumulative. It has human connotations. The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize  but also it looks like it's a robot  and it comes from a sci fi genus. It's a surprise that it has humanity  but also man made  future  alien associations. And it's just a bit spooky. The bus was done with a cargo scanning X ray machine  which is used on the borders between countries  looking for contraband and illegal immigrants. The lorry goes in front of it. And it takes slices of X rays through the lorry. And that's how this was done. It's actually slice  slice. It's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital. Slices. And then if you look carefully  there is all little things. He's got headphones on  reading the newspaper  got a hat on  glasses  got a bag. So  these little details help to make it work  make it real. The problem with using living people is that to take an X ray  if I X ray you  you get exposed to radiation. So  to avoid that    I have to avoid it somehow    is I use dead people. Now  that's a variety of things  from recently deceased bodies  to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers to train in taking X rays of the human body  at different densities. I have very high tech equipment of gloves  scissors and a bucket. I will show how the capillary action works  how it feeds  I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem. Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves. Look at this monster. It's so basic. It just grows wild. That's what I really like about it  the fact that I haven't got to go and buy it  and it hasn't been genetically modified at all. It's just happening. And the X ray shows how beautiful nature can be. Not that that is particularly beautiful when you look at it with the human eye  the way the leaves form. They're curling back on each other. So the X ray will show the overlaps in these little corners. The thicker the object  the more radiation it needs  and the more time it needs. The lighter the object  the less radiation. Sometimes you keep the time up  because the time gives you detail. The longer the exposure goes on for  the more detail you get. If you look at this  just the tube  it is quite bright. But I could get a bit darker in the tube  but everything else would suffer. So  these leaves at the edge would start to disappear. What I like is how hard the edges are  how sharp. Yeah  I'm quite pleased with it. I travel beyond the surface and show something for what it's worth  for what it's really made of  how it really works. But also I find that I've got the benefit of taking away all the surface  which is things that people are used to seeing. And that's the sort of thing I've been doing. I've got the opportunity now to show you what I'm going to be doing in the future. This is a commercial application of my most recent work. And what's good about this  I think  is that it's like a moment in time  like you've turned around  you've got X ray vision and you've taken a picture with the X ray camera. Unfortunately I haven't got X ray vision. I do dream in X ray. I see my projects in my sleep. And I know what they're going to look like in X ray and I'm not far off. So  what am I doing in the future  Well  this year is the   th anniversary of Issigonis's Mini  which is one of my favorite cars. So  I've taken it apart  component by component  months and months and months of work. And with this image  I'm going to be displaying it in the Victoria and Albert Museum as a light box  which is actually attached to the car. So  I've got to saw the car in half  down the middle  not an easy task  in itself. And then  so you can get in the driver's side  sit down  and up against you is a wall. And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car  you see a life sized light box of the car showing you how it works. And I'm going to take that idea and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life. Like  my first computer was a big movement in my life. And I had a Mac Classic. And it's a little box. And I think that would look quite neat as an X ray. I'm also looking to take my work from the two dimensional form to a more three dimensional form. And this is quite a good way of doing it. I'm also working now with X ray video. So  if you can imagine  some of these flowers  and they're actually moving and growing and you can film that in X ray  should be quite stunning. But that's it. I'm done. Thank you very much. Something called the Danish Twin Study established that only about    percent of how long the average person lives  within certain biological limits  is dictated by our genes. The other    percent is dictated by our lifestyle. So the premise of Blue Zones  if we can find the optimal lifestyle of longevity we can come up with a de facto formula for longevity. But if you ask the average American what the optimal formula of longevity is  they probably couldn't tell you. They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet  or the Atkins Diet. You have the USDA food pyramid. There is what Oprah tells us. There is what Doctor Oz tells us. The fact of the matter is there is a lot of confusion around what really helps us live longer better. Should you be running marathons or doing yoga  Should you eat organic meats or should you be eating tofu  When it comes to supplements  should you be taking them  How about these hormones or resveratrol  And does purpose play into it  Spirituality  And how about how we socialize  Well  our approach to finding longevity was to team up with National Geographic  and the National Institute on Aging  to find the four demographically confirmed areas that are geographically defined. And then bring a team of experts in there to methodically go through exactly what these people do  to distill down the cross cultural distillation. And at the end of this I'm going to tell you what that distillation is. But first I'd like to debunk some common myths when it comes to longevity. And the first myth is if you try really hard you can live to be    . False. The problem is  only about one out of       people in America live to be    . Your chances are very low. Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America  it's hard to reach    . The problem is that we're not programmed for longevity. We are programmed for something called procreative success. I love that word. It reminds me of my college days. Biologists term procreative success to mean the age where you have children and then another generation  the age when your children have children. After that the effect of evolution completely dissipates. If you're a mammal  if you're a rat or an elephant  or a human  in between  it's the same story. So to make it to age      you not only have to have had a very good lifestyle  you also have to have won the genetic lottery. The second myth is  there are treatments that can help slow  reverse  or even stop aging. False. When you think of it  there is    things that can age us. Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes  those brain cells die  they never come back. Play tennis too hard  on your knees  ruin your cartilage  the cartilage never comes back. Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque  and we can get Alzheimer's. There is just too many things to go wrong. Our bodies have    trillion cells  trillion with a  T.  We're talking national debt numbers here. Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years. And every time they turn themselves over there is some damage. And that damage builds up. And it builds up exponentially. It's a little bit like the days when we all had Beatles albums or Eagles albums and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape  and let our friends copy that cassette tape  and pretty soon  with successive generations that tape sounds like garbage. Well  the same things happen to our cells. That's why a    year old person is aging at a rate of about     times faster than a    year old person. So  if there is nothing you can do to slow your aging or stop your aging  what am I doing here  Well  the fact of the matter is the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body  my body  your body  is about    years  a little bit more for women. But life expectancy in this country is only   . So somewhere along the line  we're leaving about    good years on the table. These are years that we could get. And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease  heart disease  cancer and diabetes. We think the best way to get these missing years is to look at the cultures around the world that are actually experiencing them  areas where people are living to age     at rates up to    times greater than we are  areas where the life expectancy is an extra dozen years  the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction of what it is in this country. We found our first Blue Zone about     miles off the coast of Italy  on the island of Sardinia. And not the entire island  the island is about  .  million people  but only up in the highlands  an area called the Nuoro province. And here we have this area where men live the longest  about    times more centenarians than we have here in America. And this is a place where people not only reach age      they do so with extraordinary vigor. Places where     year olds still ride their bike to work  chop wood  and can beat a guy    years younger than them. Their history actually goes back to about the time of Christ. It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated. Because the land is so infertile  they largely are shepherds  which occasions regular  low intensity physical activity. Their diet is mostly plant based  accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields. They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread called carta musica made out of durum wheat  a type of cheese made from grass fed animals so the cheese is high in Omega   fatty acids instead of Omega   fatty acids from corn fed animals  and a type of wine that has three times the level of polyphenols than any known wine in the world. It's called Cannonau. But the real secret I think lies more in the way that they organize their society. And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society is how they treat older people. You ever notice here in America  social equity seems to peak at about age     Just look at the advertisements. Here in Sardinia  the older you get the more equity you have  the more wisdom you're celebrated for. You go into the bars in Sardinia  instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar  you see the centenarian of the month calendar. This  as it turns out  is not only good for your aging parents to keep them close to the family    it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy    research shows it's also good for the children of those families  who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease. That's called the grandmother effect. We found our second Blue Zone on the other side of the planet  about     miles south of Tokyo  on the archipelago of Okinawa. Okinawa is actually     small islands. And in the northern part of the main island  this is ground zero for world longevity. This is a place where the oldest living female population is found. It's a place where people have the longest disability free life expectancy in the world. They have what we want. They live a long time  and tend to die in their sleep  very quickly  and often  I can tell you  after sex. They live about seven good years longer than the average American. Five times as many centenarians as we have in America. One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer  big killers here in America. And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease. And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers suggests strongly they have something to teach us. What do they do  Once again  a plant based diet  full of vegetables with lots of color in them. And they eat about eight times as much tofu as Americans do. More significant than what they eat is how they eat it. They have all kinds of little strategies to keep from overeating  which  as you know  is a big problem here in America. A few of the strategies we observed  they eat off of smaller plates  so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting. Instead of serving family style  where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking  they serve at the counter  put the food away  and then bring it to the table. They also have a       year old adage  which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented. It was invented by Confucius. And that diet is known as the Hara  Hatchi  Bu diet. It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is      percent full. It takes about a half hour for that full feeling to travel from your belly to your brain. And by remembering to stop at    percent it helps keep you from doing that very thing. But  like Sardinia  Okinawa has a few social constructs that we can associate with longevity. We know that isolation kills. Fifteen years ago  the average American had three good friends. We're down to one and half right now. If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa  you were born into a system where you automatically have a half a dozen friends with whom you travel through life. They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck  and if things go bad  child gets sick  parent dies  you always have somebody who has your back. This particular Moai  these five ladies have been together for    years. Their average age is    . Typically in America we've divided our adult life up into two sections. There is our work life  where we're productive. And then one day  boom  we retire. And typically that has meant retiring to the easy chair  or going down to Arizona to play golf. In the Okinawan language there is not even a word for retirement. Instead there is one word that imbues your entire life  and that word is  ikigai.  And  roughly translated  it means  the reason for which you wake up in the morning.  For this     year old karate master  his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art. For this hundred year old fisherman it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week. And this is a question. The National Institute on Aging actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians. And one of the questions  they were very culturally astute  the people who put the questionnaire. One of the questions was   What is your ikigai   They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning. For this     year old woman  her ikigai was simply her great great great granddaughter. Two girls separated in age by     and a half years. And I asked her what it felt like to hold a great great great granddaughter. And she put her head back and she said   It feels like leaping into heaven.  I thought that was a wonderful thought. My editor at Geographic wanted me to find America's Blue Zone. And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota  where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians. But that's because all the young people left. So  we turned to the data again. And we found America's longest lived population among the Seventh Day Adventists concentrated in and around Loma Linda  California. Adventists are conservative Methodists. They celebrate their Sabbath from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday. A     hour sanctuary in time   they call it. And they follow five little habits that conveys to them extraordinary longevity  comparatively speaking. In America here  life expectancy for the average woman is   . But for an Adventist woman  their life expectancy is   . And the difference is even more pronounced among men  who are expected to live about    years longer than their American counterparts. Now  this is a study that followed about        people for    years. Sterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates the premise of this Blue Zone project. This is a heterogeneous community. It's white  black  Hispanic  Asian. The only thing that they have in common are a set of very small lifestyle habits that they follow ritualistically for most of their lives. They take their diet directly from the Bible. Genesis  Chapter one  Verse       where God talks about legumes and seeds  and on one more stanza about green plants  ostensibly missing is meat. They take this sanctuary in time very serious. For    hours every week  no matter how busy they are  how stressed out they are at work  where the kids need to be driven  they stop everything and they focus on their God  their social network  and then  hardwired right in the religion  are nature walks. And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally  the power is it's done every week for a lifetime. None of it's hard. None of it costs money. Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists. So  if you go to an Adventist's party you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint. Instead they're talking about their next nature walk  exchanging recipes  and yes  they pray. But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways. This is a culture that has yielded Ellsworth Whareham. Ellsworth Whareham is    years old. He's a multimillionaire  yet when a contractor wanted       dollars to build a privacy fence  he said   For that kind of money I'll do it myself.  So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement  and hauling poles around. And predictably  perhaps  on the fourth day he ended up in the operating room. But not as the guy on the table  the guy doing open heart surgery. At    he still does    open heart surgeries every month. Ed Rawlings      years old now  an active cowboy  starts his morning with a swim. And on weekends he likes to put on the boards  throw up rooster tails. And then Marge Deton. Marge is    . Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here. She starts her day with lifting weights. She rides her bicycle. And then she gets in her root beer colored      Cadillac Seville  and tears down the San Bernardino freeway  where she still volunteers for seven different organizations. I've been on    hardcore expeditions. I'm probably the only person you'll ever meet who rode his bicycle across the Sahara desert without sunscreen. But I'll tell you  there is no adventure more harrowing than riding shotgun with Marge Deton.  A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet   she'd say to me. So  what are the common denominators in these three cultures  What are the things that they all do  And we managed to boil it down to nine. In fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this and these common denominators hold true. And the first one  and I'm about to utter a heresy here  none of them exercise  at least the way we think of exercise. Instead  they set up their lives so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity. These     year old Okinawan women are getting up and down off the ground  they sit on the floor     or    times a day. Sardinians live in vertical houses  up and down the stairs. Every trip to the store  or to church or to a friend's house occasions a walk. They don't have any conveniences. There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work. If they want to mix up a cake  they're doing it by hand. That's physical activity. That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does. When they do do intentional physical activity  it's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk  the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline  and they all tend to have a garden. They know how to set up their life in the right way so they have the right outlook. Each of these cultures take time to downshift. The Sardinians pray. The Seventh Day Adventists pray. The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration. But when you're in a hurry or stressed out  that triggers something called the inflammatory response  which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's disease to cardiovascular disease. When you slow down for    minutes a day you turn that inflammatory state into a more anti inflammatory state. They have vocabulary for sense of purpose  ikigai  like the Okinawans. You know the two most dangerous years in your life are the year you're born  because of infant mortality  and the year you retire. These people know their sense of purpose  and they activate in their life  that's worth about seven years of extra life expectancy. There's no longevity diet. Instead  these people drink a little bit every day  not a hard sell to the American population. They tend to eat a plant based diet. Doesn't mean they don't eat meat  but lots of beans and nuts. And they have strategies to keep from overeating  little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time. And then the foundation of all this is how they connect. They put their families first  take care of their children and their aging parents. They all tend to belong to a faith based community  which is worth between four and    extra years of life expectancy if you do it four times a month. And the biggest thing here is they also belong to the right tribe. They were either born into or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people. We know from the Framingham studies  that if your three best friends are obese there is a    percent better chance that you'll be overweight. So  if you hang out with unhealthy people  that's going to have a measurable impact over time. Instead  if your friend's idea of recreation is physical activity  bowling  or playing hockey  biking or gardening  if your friends drink a little  but not too much  and they eat right  and they're engaged  and they're trusting and trustworthy  that is going to have the biggest impact over time. Diets don't work. No diet in the history of the world has ever worked for more than two percent of the population. Exercise programs usually start in January  they're usually done by October. When it comes to longevity there is no short term fix in a pill or anything else. But when you think about it  your friends are long term adventures  and therefore  perhaps the most significant thing you can do to add more years to your life  and life to your years. Thank you very much. I want you to put off your preconceptions  your preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles. Because that is the only way I'm going to get my story across to you. And by the way  if I come across as a sort of rabid  hippie conservationist  it's purely a figment of your imagination. Okay. We are actually the first species on Earth to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival. And I know we've all seen images enough to make us numb  of the tragedies that we're perpetrating on the planet. We're kind of like greedy kids  using it all up  aren't we  And today is a time for me to talk to you about water. It's not only because we like to drink lots of it  and its marvelous derivatives  beer  wine  etc. And  of course  watch it fall from the sky and flow in our wonderful rivers  but for several other reasons as well. When I was a kid  growing up in New York  I was smitten by snakes  the same way most kids are smitten by tops  marbles  cars  trains  cricket balls. And my mother  brave lady  was partly to blame  taking me to the New York Natural History Museum  buying me books on snakes  and then starting this infamous career of mine  which has culminated in of course  arriving in India    years ago  brought by my mother  Doris Norden  and my stepfather  Rama Chattopadhyaya. It's been a roller coaster ride. Two animals  two iconic reptiles really captivated me very early on. One of them was the remarkable gharial. This crocodile  which grows to almost    feet long in the northern rivers  and this charismatic snake  the king cobra. What my purpose of the talk today really is  is to sort of indelibly scar your minds with these charismatic and majestic creatures. Because this is what you will take away from here  a reconnection with nature  I hope. The king cobra is quite remarkable for several reasons. What you're seeing here is very recently shot images in a forest nearby here  of a female king cobra making her nest. Here is a limbless animal  capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves  and then laying her eggs inside  to withstand   to     meters of rainfall   in order that the eggs can incubate over the next    days  and hatch into little baby king cobras. So  she protects her eggs  and after three months  the babies finally do hatch out. A majority of them will die  of course. There is very high mortality in little baby reptiles who are just    to    inches long. My first experience with king cobras was in '   at a magical place called Agumbe  in Karnataka  this state. And it is a marvelous rain forest. This first encounter was kind of like the Maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior. It really changed my life totally. And it brought me straight into the conservation fray. I ended up starting this research and education station in Agumbe  which you are all of course invited to visit. This is basically a base wherein we are trying to gather and learn virtually everything about the biodiversity of this incredibly complex forest system  and try to hang on to what's there  make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean  and of course  having a good time too. You can almost hear the drums throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there. It was very important for us to get through to the people. And through the children is usually the way to go. They are fascinated with snakes. They haven't got that steely thing that you end up either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way. They are interested. And it really works to start with them. This gives you an idea of the size of some of these snakes. This is an average size king cobra  about    feet long. And it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom  and was hanging around there for two or three days. The people of this part of India worship the king cobra. And they didn't kill it. They called us to catch it. Now we've caught more than     king cobras over the last three years  and relocated them in nearby forests. But in order to find out the real secrets of these creatures  it was necessary  for us to actually insert a small radio transmitter inside  each  snake. Now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets  where the babies go after they hatch  and remarkable things like this you're about to see. This was just a few days ago in Agumbe. I had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra who had caught a venomous pit viper. And it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself. And king cobras feed only on snakes. This  little snake  was kind of a tid bit for it  what we'd call a  vadai  or a donut or something like that. Usually they eat something a bit larger. In this case a rather strange and inexplicable activity happened over the last breeding season  wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra  didn't mate with it  actually killed it and swallowed it. We're still trying to explain and come to terms with what is the evolutionary advantage of this. But they do also a lot of other remarkable things. This is again  something  we were able to see  by virtue of the fact that we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes. This male snake     feet long  met another male king cobra. And they did this incredible ritual combat dance. It's very much like the rutting of mammals  including humans  you know  sorting out our differences  but gentler  no biting allowed. It's just a wresting match  but a remarkable activity. Now  what are we doing with all this information  What's the point of all this  Well  the king cobra is literally a keystone species in these rainforests. And our job is to convince the authorities that these forests have to be protected. And this is one of the ways we do it  by learning as much as we can about something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there  in order to help protect trees  animals and of course the water sources. You've all heard  perhaps  of Project Tiger which started back in the early '  s  which was  in fact  a very dynamic time for conservation. We were piloted  I could say  by a highly autocratic stateswoman  but who also had an incredible passion for environment. And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged. And  just like Project Tiger  our activities with the king cobra is to look at a species of animal so that we protect its habitat and everything within it. So  the tiger is the icon. And now the king cobra is a new one. All the major rivers in south India are sourced in the Western Ghats  the chain of hills running along the west coast of India. It pours out millions of gallons every hour  and supplies drinking water to at least     million people  and washes many  many babies  and of course feeds many  many animals  both domestic and wild  produces thousands of tons of rice. And what do we do  How do we respond to this  Well  basically  we dam it  we pollute it  we pour in pesticides  weedicides  fungicides. You drink it in peril of your life. And the thing is  it's not just big industry. It's not misguided river engineers who are doing all this  it's us. It seems that our citizens find the best way to dispose of garbage are in water sources. Okay. Now we're going north  very far north. North central India  the Chambal River is where we have our base. This is the home of the gharial  this incredible crocodile. It is an animal which has been on the Earth for just about     million years. It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off. It has remarkable features. Even though it grows to    feet long  since it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings. It does have big teeth  however  and it's kind of hard to convince people if an animal has big teeth  that it's a harmless creature. But we  actually  back in the early '  s  did surveys  and found that gharial were extremely rare. In fact  if you see the map  the range of their original habitat was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan to the Irrawaddy in Burma. And now it's just limited to a couple of spots in Nepal and India. So  in fact at this point there are only     breeding gharial left in the wild. So  starting in the mid '  s when conservation was at the fore  we were actually able to start projects which were basically government supported to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests and release       baby gharial back to the wild. And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this. I mean  just incredible to see bunches of gharial basking on the river again. But complacency does have a tendency to breed contempt. And  sure enough  with all the other pressures on the river  like sand mining  for example  very  very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge  not allowing the animals to breed anymore  we're looking at even more problems building up for the gharial  despite the early good intentions. Their nests hatching along the riverside producing hundreds of hatchlings. It's just an amazing sight. This was actually just taken last year. But then the monsoon arrives  and unfortunately downriver there is always a dam or there is always a barrage  and  shoop  they get washed down to their doom. Luckily there is still a lot of interest. My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN  the  Madras Crocodile Bank   an NGO  the World Wildlife Fund  the Wildlife Institute of India  State Forest Departments  and the Ministry of Environment  we all work together on stuff. But it's possibly  and definitely not enough. For example  in the winter of      and       there was this incredible die off of gharial  in the Chambal River. Suddenly dozens of gharial appearing on the river  dead. Why  How could it happen  This is a relatively clean river. The Chambal  if you look at it  has clear water. People scoop water out of the Chambal and drink it  something you wouldn't do in most north Indian rivers. So  in order to try to find out the answer to this  we got veterinarians from all over the world working with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening. I was there for a lot of the necropsies on the riverside. And we actually looked through all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on. And it came down to something called gout  which  as a result of kidney breakdown is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body  and worse in the joints  which made the gharial unable to swim. And it's a horribly painful death. Just downriver from the Chambal is the filthy Yamuna river  the sacred Yamuna river. And I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it but it's the truth. It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine. It flows down through Delhi  Mathura  Agra  and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine. So  it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial was something in the food chain  something in the fish they were eating. And  you know  once a toxin is in the food chain everything is affected  including us. Because these rivers are the lifeblood of people all along their course. In order to try to answer some of these questions  we again turn to technology  to biological technology  in this case  again  telemetry  putting radios on    gharial  and actually following their movements. They're being watched everyday as we speak  to try to find out what this mysterious toxin is. The Chambal river is an absolutely incredible place. It's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know about the bandits  the dacoits who used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around. But Poolan Devi was one  of them . Which actually Shekhar Kapur made an incredible movie   The Bandit Queen   which I urge you to see. You'll get to see the incredible  Chambal  landscape as well. But  again  heavy fishing pressures. This is one of the last repositories of the Ganges river dolphin  various species of turtles  thousands of migratory birds  and fishing is causing problems like this. And now  these  new elements of human intolerance for river creatures like the gharial means that if they don't drown in the net  then they simply cut their beaks off. Animals like the Ganges river dolphin which is just down to a few left  and it is also critically endangered. So  who is next  Us  Because we are all dependent on these water sources. So  we all know about the Narmada river  the tragedies of dams  the tragedies of huge projects which displace people and wreck river systems without providing livelihoods. And development just basically going berserk  for a double figure growth index  basically. So  we're not sure where this story is going to end  whether it's got a happy or sad ending. And climate change is certainly going to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads. We're still working hard at it. We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there. And the thing is  you know  the decision makers  the folks in power  they're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi  in the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool. But out on the rivers there are still millions of people who are in really bad shape. And it's a bleak future for them. So  we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project. We've spent hundreds of millions of dollars on it  and nothing to show for it. Incredible. So  people talk about political will. During the die off of the gharial we did galvanize a lot of action. Government cut through all the red tape  we got foreign vets on it. It was great. So  we can do it. But if you stroll down to the Yamuna or to the Gomati in Lucknow  or to the Adyar river in Chennai  or the Mula Mutha river in Pune  just see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad. But I think the final note really is that we can do it. The corporates  the artists  the wildlife nuts  the good old everyday folks can actually bring these rivers back. And the final word is that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders. And there is a gharial looking at us from the river. And these are powerful water totems. And they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing. Namaste. Chris Anderson  Thanks  Rom. Thanks a lot. You know  most people are terrified of snakes. And there might be quite a few people here who would be very glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust. Do you have those conversations with people  How do you really get them to care  Romulus Whitaker  I take the sort of humble approach  I guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly. It's not like the teddy bear. But I sort of    there is an innocence in these animals. And when the average person looks at a cobra going  Ssssss   like that  they say   My god  look at that angry  dangerous creature.  I look at it as a creature who is totally frightened of something so dangerous as a human being. And that is the truth. And that's what I try to get out. CA  Now  incredible footage you showed of the viper being killed. You were saying that that hasn't been filmed before. RW  Yes  this is actually the first time anyone of us knew about it  for one thing. As I said  it's just like a little snack for him  you know  Usually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes  or even cobras. But this guy who we're following right now is in the deep jungle. Whereas other king cobras very often come into the human interface  you know  the plantations  to find big rat snakes and stuff. This guy specializes in pit vipers. And the guy who is working there with them  he's from Maharashtra  he said   I think he's after the nusha.  Now  the nusha means the high. Whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush. CA  Thanks Rom. Thank you. Hi. For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears  these are the dancing bears. In       we started working on a two year investigative research project to try and find out what was going on. Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted because of this. This is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community who live across India  and have been in India since the   th century. We went about getting evidence of what was going on. And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button. And we went in  pretending to be buyers. And we found this right in this very state  in Karnataka. And the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country and being sold and traded. These were being sold for about       dollars each  and they are used for bear paw soup  and also being trained  later on  to become dancing bears like the one you just saw. Sadly  the family of Qalandars depended on this bear. The couple are barely    years old. They already have four children beside them. You can see them. And the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals. So  we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner. Now  when we started working deeper and digging deeper  we found that it's an illegal act. These guys could go to jail for up to seven years if they were caught by authorities. And what they were doing to the bears was really appalling. It was unacceptable. The mother bears are usually killed. The cubs  which are taken  are separated. Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod. And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle. Now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that for a livelihood  to getting something else. So  this is Bitu Qalandar  who was our first experiment. And we were so unsure that this would work. We weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him. And we said   Okay  here is some seed fund. Let's see if you can get something else.  And we got the bear surrendered to    we set up a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India. And now he sells cool drinks  he's by the highway. He has a telephone booth. And then it started  there was no turning back after that. This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear. And now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store near Agra. Then there was no looking back at all for us. We gave cycle rickshaws. We set up carpet weaving units  vocational training for the women. The women were just not allowed to come out of the community and work with mainstream society. So  we were able to address that. Education. The kids never went to school. They only had Islamic education  very little of it. And they were never allowed to go to school because they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education. So  we sponsor     children education programs today. We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people. Of course we also had to get the bears in. This is what happens to the bears when they come in. And this is what we turn them into. We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers. So  basically in      there were       dancing bears. We rescued over     dancing bears. We've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears. The big news that I want to announce today is that next month we will be bringing in the very last bear of India  into our rescue center. And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice which has been here for centuries. And the people can hold their heads up high. And the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past that they've lived all their lives. And the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again. And there will be no more removing of these bears. And the children  both humans and bear cubs can live peacefully. Thank you. Contagious is a good word. Even in the times of H N   I like the word. Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious. Inspiration is contagious. We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers. But for me  what was contagious about all of them was that they were infected by something I call the  I Can  bug. So  the question is  why only them  In a country of a billion people and some  why so few  Is it luck  Is it chance  Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected  So  in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story. I got infected when I was     when  as a student of the design college  I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas  challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me. And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt  and how contagious that feeling was. I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven. So  when I started Riverside school    years ago it became a lab  a lab to prototype and refine a design process that could consciously infect the mind with the  I Can  bug. And I uncovered that if learning is embedded in real world context  that if you blur the boundaries between school and life  then children go through a journey of  aware   where they can see the change   enable   be changed  and then  empower   lead the change. And that directly increased student wellbeing. Children became more competent  and less helpless. But this was all common sense. So  I'd like to show you a little glimpse of what common practice looks like at Riverside. A little background  when my grade five was learning about child rights  they were made to roll incense sticks  agarbattis  for eight hours to experience what it means to be a child laborer. It transformed them. What you will see is their journey  and then their utter conviction that they could go out and change the world. That's them rolling. And in two hours  after their backs were broke  they were changed. And once that happened  they were out in the city convincing everybody that child labor just had to be abolished. And look at Ragav  that moment when his face changes because he's been able to understand that he has shifted that man's mindset. And that can't happen in a classroom. So  when Ragav experienced that he went from  teacher told me   to  I am doing it.  And that's the  I Can  mindshift. And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured. But we had parents who said   Okay  making our children good human beings is all very well  but what about math and science and English  Show us the grades.  And we did. The data was conclusive. When children are empowered  not only do they do good  they do well  in fact very well  as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment taken by over       schools in India  Riverside children were outperforming the top    schools in India in math  English and science. So  it worked. It was now time to take it outside Riverside. So  on August   th  Independence Day        the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad. Now it was not about Riverside school. It was about all children. So  we were shameless. We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation  the police  the press  businesses  and basically said   When are you going to wake up and recognize the potential that resides in every child  When will you include the child in the city  Basically  open your hearts and your minds to the child.  So  how did the city respond  Since      every other month the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic and converts it into a playground for children and childhood. Here was a city telling its child   You can.  A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad. Video   Unclear  So  the busiest streets closed down. We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us. It gets taken over by children. They are skating. They are doing street plays. They are playing  all free  for all children. Atul Karwal  aProCh is an organization which has been doing things for kids earlier. And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city. Kiran Bir Sethi  And the city will give free time. And Ahmedabad got the first child friendly zebra crossing in the world. Geet Sethi  When a city gives to the children  in the future the children will give back to the city. KBS  And because of that  Ahmedabad is known as India's first child friendly city. So  you're getting the pattern. First     children at Riverside. Then        children in Ahmedabad  and growing. It was time now to infect India. So  on August   th  again  Independence Day        empowered with the same process  we empowered         children to say   I can.  How  We designed a simple toolkit  converted it into eight languages  and reached        schools. We basically gave children a very simple challenge. We said  take one idea  anything that bothers you  choose one week  and change a billion lives. And they did. Stories of change poured in from all over India  from Nagaland in the east  to Jhunjhunu in the west  from Sikkim in the north  to Krishnagiri in the south. Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems. Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street to alcoholism  and    children who stopped    child marriages in Rajasthan. I mean  it was incredible. Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children and say   You can   then they will. Infection in India. This is in Rajasthan  a rural village. Child  Our parents are illiterate and we want to teach them how to read and write. KBS  First time  a rally and a street play in a rural school    unheard of    to tell their parents why literacy is important. Look at what their parents says. Man  This program is wonderful. We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write. Woman  I am so happy that my students did this campaign. In the future  I will never doubt my students' abilities. See  They have done it. KBS  An inner city school in Hyderabad. Girl     . This house is     ... We have to start collecting from    . KBS  Girls and boys in Hyderabad  going out  pretty difficult  but they did it. Woman  Even though they are so young  they have done such good work. First they have cleaned the society  then it will be Hyderabad  and soon India. Woman  It was a revelation for me. It doesn't strike me that they had so much inside them. Girl  Thank you  ladies and gentlemen. For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you  for a very good cause  the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids. Are you ready  ladies and gentlemen  Audience  Yes  Girl  Are you ready  Audience  Yes  Girl  Are you ready  Audience  Yes  KBS  So  the charter of compassion starts right here. Street plays  auctions  petitions. I mean  they were changing lives. It was incredible. So  how can we still stay immune  How can we stay immune to that passion  that energy  that excitement  I know it's obvious  but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change  Gandhiji.    years ago  it took one man to infect an entire nation with the power of  We can.  So  today who is it going to take to spread the infection from         children to the     million children in India  Last I heard  the preamble still said   We  the people of India   right  So  if not us  then who  If not now  then when  Like I said  contagious is a good word. Thank you. I am going to be talking about secrets. Obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it. Secrets. I'm using PowerPoint this year just because  you know  I'm into the TED thing. And when you use these things you don't have to go like that. You just press it. Oh  man. Um  yes. Yes. I'm sure  Just change it  Is Bill Gates here  Change it  Come on  What  Ah  Okay. That's not my slides  but it's okay. As you can see  these are all maps. And maps are important devices for transferring information  especially if you have human cognitive ability. We can see that all formulas are really maps. Now  as humans  we make maps of places that we seldom even go  which seems a little wasteful of time. This  of course  is a map of the moon. There're some very delightful names. Tranquilacalitis   unclear . My favorite is Frigoris. What are these people thinking  Frigoris  What the Frigoris you doing  Names are important. Frigoris  This is the Moon. People could live there one day. I'll meet you at Frigoris. No. I don't think so. There we see Mars  again with various names. And this is all done  by the way  by the International Astronomical Union. This is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects. This is from their actual book. These are some of the names that they have chosen  ladies and gentlemen. I'll go through a little of them. Bolotnitsa. That  of course  is the Slavic swamp mermaid. Now I think the whole concept of a mermaid doesn't really blend into the swamp feel.  Oh look  Mermaid come out of swamp. Oh boy  It's time for Bolotnitsa   Djabran Fluctus. If that don't flow off the tongue  what does  I mean kids are studying this stuff and they've got the word  fluctus  up there. That's wrong. One dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life.  It fluctus up  Mama.  Hikuleo Fluctus. That's a little more flowing. Hikuleo sounds like a kind of a Leonardo DiCaprio    syllable thing. And that's the Tonga underworld. And one of my favorites is the Itoki Fluctus  who is the Nicaraguan goddess of insects  stars  and planets. Now  if you're a goddess of stars and planets wouldn't you relegate insects to somebody else   No  no  really  I'm so busy with the stars. Would you mind taking the insects  Thank you darling. Oh take the spiders too. I know they're not insects  but I don't care. Monkeys  chimps  just get rid of the hairy creatures.  Now  we're going to be going to Mars one day. And when we do  it's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names. So  you'll be on Mars  and you're at Hellespointica Depressio which has got to be a really  up  place. Yeah  I'm at the Depressio  and I want to get over to Amazonis so I plug it into the Mars map  and click the button and there's my directions. I go to Chrysokeras. Then to Niliacus Lacus  which is not a bad name. Niliacus Lacus  try to get the practice  slick a tick a bacus. That's a cool name. I will say that. So  I hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers. And then of course Arnon to Thoth. And of course there will be advertisements. This is from their rule book  the International Astronomical Union. And you know they're international because they put it  en Francais  as well. L'Union Astronomique Internationale  for those of you who don't speak French. I thought I'd translate for you. From the rulebook  Nomenclature is a tool. The first consideration  make it clear  simple and unambiguous. And I think that Djabran Fluctus  that fits that mode. That's simple  the goddess of goats  very simple. Djabran Fluctus.  Now  Frank is this clear to you  Djabran Fluctus    Yeah  that's the goat goddess right  The Abacazanian  It's clear to me.   Listen  I'm going back to the swamp mermaid. Can you call me in a little while   Also  from the actual document I highlighted a part I thought may be of interest. Anyone can suggest changing a name. So  I look to you  fellow member of the Earth community. We've got to change this stuff up fast. So  these are actual names of people that work there. I did some more investigation. These are more people working for this group. And  as you can see  they don't use their first names. These are people naming planets  and they won't use their first names. Something is askew here. Is it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck  Is that Ganymede Andromeda Burba  Is that Mars Ya Marov  I don't know. But it's investigative material  no doubt. There are some mapping people who do use their names. Witness please  Eugene Shoemaker  who  diligently  from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies. Must have been a very interesting day in the Shoemaker house.  Mom  I want to make maps.   That's wonderful Eugene. You could make maps of Toronto.   No  I want to make maps of planets.   Yeah  go to your room.  Martians  Venusians  Jovians. We have names for places where people don't exist. That seems a little silly to me. There are no Jovians. Getting back to my premise  I used stamps  by the way  because you don't have to pay anybody for the rights. There is obviously Einstein  Niels Bohr  de Fermat's last theorem  and I'm not sure whether that's James Coburn or Richard Harris. It's definitely one of the two. I'm not really clear which one. But obviously the point is that numbers are maps. And within numbers  is there an underlying secret to the universe  That is the premise of this particular presentation. By the way  that's a natural picture of Saturn  no adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful. So beautiful that I will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet  and the day Saturday  named after it  wonderfully. So  formulas relate number to form. That's Euler  his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool  not that funny  but it is cool. He was also famous for having no body. Which a lot of you are like   How did he figure that out   He's got no body  no man  just a head floating high. Here comes Euler. And that's an icosahedron  which is one of the five sacred solids  very important shapes. You see the icosahedron again. The dodecahedron  it's dual. There is a dodecahedron which I had to do in my room last night. The five sacred solids  as you can see there. Which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads. Blue cheese  ranch  oil and vinegar  thousand islands and house. I suggest the house. The reality  now here is something important. What's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other. And you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other. So  the whole concept of branes in the universe  if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be. And that is  of course  what we are here to talk about. What a coincidence  October  th  in France  Jean Pierre Luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron  based on information that they got from this probe. This would be a normal wave pattern. But what they're seeing  way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background  is this kind of odd undulation. It doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be. So  you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture  so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like. And judging from this  it looks a little like a cheeseburger. So  I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger. And for me  that's a win win. Everybody goes  I'm happy. Better really hurry up. I just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are  without heart and without love it's just    it's all meaningless. And that  to me  is really beautiful. Except for that creepy guy in the background. Getting back to the point of my particular presentation  Kepler  one of my great heroes  who realized that these five solids  which I spoke of earlier  were related somehow to the planets  but he couldn't prove it. It freaked him out. But it did lead to Newton discovering gravity. So  maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge. Now this is Isaac from a Vietnamese stamp. I am not suggesting at all that my Vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there. But ... that's not a good picture. Not a good picture. Now  my friends in the island of Nevis are a little better. Look at that  That's Isaac Newton. That guy is rockin'. What a handsome cat. Once again  Nicaragua let me down. And Copernicus looks like Johnny Carson  which is really weird. I don't get that at all. Once again  these guys rock it out. Isaac is kickin' ass. Man  he looks like a rock star. This is freaky is a major way. This is Sierra Leone. They got little babies in there  floating in there. Man. I don't really need to comment on this. But I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in the Moody Blues. Did you  When did this happen  It's a different kind of course. And they've got five apples  I mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid. Although five is a good number  of course. Ecuador  my friend Kepler  as you can see  they call him Juan. Juan  No  Johannes  not Juan. It wasn't Carlos Chaplain. It's wrong. Ren  Descartes  of course. Once again these Grenada people  this is like way too sick for anybody's imagination. He's all murky. There is little kids leaning on his leg  little ghosts flying around. We gotta clean this stuff up fast  ladies and gentlemen. This is  of course  the Cartesian coordinates. Once again  that's Sierra Leone. This is again  indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form  maps of the universe. Because that's why we're here  really  I think to figure stuff out and to love each other. Descartes.  Laughter  Before the horse.  Laughter  Now  Monaco took Descartes  and just flipped him around. Now  Monaco is problematic for me  and I'll show you why. Here is a map. All they have is a casino on it. And why Franklin Delano Roosevelt is on their map I don't even want to hazard a guess. But I'd say he'd been to Hellespointica Depressio recently. This is the flag of Monaco. Ladies and gentlemen  the flag of Indonesia. Please examine. Not sure how this came to be  but it's not right. In Monaco   No  what are you talking about  They are so different. Look  ours is more red  it's longer. They stole our flag  They stole our flag   Bode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus. And the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work. That's Jude Law and some of his films recently didn't work. Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted. And I wonder if the photographer said   Okay  Jude  could you touch your tooth  That's good.  Just a tip  if you're being photographed for press pictures  don't touch your teeth. Prime numbers  Gauss  one of my favorites. Golden section  I've been obsessed with this thing since before I was born. I know that scares a lot of you  but that was my purpose entirely. There we can see Fibonacci numbers related to the Golden Section  because Fibonacci and Golden Section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter  as I refer to it. If Fibonacci had been on Paxil  that would be the Fibonacci series.  Ten milligram     milligram.   Leonardo  dinner's ready  put down those books and take your pills.   Yes  Mama.  Alright where is this going  That's a good question. Here is the premise that I began    years ago. If numbers can express the laws of this incredible universe that we live  I reason  through some sort of reverse engineering  we could extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe. And that's what I did. Twenty seven years ago I started working on this. And I tried to build a particle accelerator. And that didn't work out well. So  then I thought a calculator is a metaphor. I can just divide numbers  that's like atom smashing. That's what I did. That's how I found Moleeds. Moleeds are what I believe the thing that will allow string theory to be proved. They are the nodes on the string  patterns and relationships        . That was the first chart I came up with. You can see  even if you don't go for the numbers  the beauty of the symmetry. The numbers from one to     divided into six groups. Symmetry  pairs. Every top adds up to   . Bottom  all   . There is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now  because you would say   Hey  go back to the Fluctus part.  Circle of Fifths  acoustic harmony  geometric symmetry. I knew those two were related. Once again  the Cartesian kind of cross over. So  I said if I'm going to put a circle  see what kind of patterns I get  boom  the Red System. Look at that. You can't just make this stuff up  ladies and gentlemen. You can't just go around going   Oh  I'm going to put some triangles in a circle and they're going to be symmetrical. And they're all going to add up  and it's going to be  oh yeah  I figured that out.  This is beyond anything anybody could just make up. There is the Orange System. And you'll see over here  these are multiples of the number   . And they recapitulate that shape  even though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of   . It's nuts. That's the Green System. It all folds in half on the Green System  right between    and   . The Blue System. The Violet. It's all there. Look at that  I mean you cannot make that stuff up. That just doesn't fall out of a tree  ladies and gentlemen. Twenty seven years of my life  And I'm presenting it here at TED. Why  Because this is the place if aliens land  I hope they come here.  We are going to destroy the Earth. Hmmm ... maybe not.  In this last year I have found these subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the Calabi Yau manifolds in a way that doesn't necessitate these little hidden dimensions. Which works mathematically  but it just doesn't seem God like to me. It just seems like it's not sexy and elegant  it's hidden. I don't want hidden  I want to see it. I found other pairs all have symmetry  even though  unlike the master one  their symmetry is split. Unbelievable. This is like crazy. Am I the only one that sees this  You know  I didn't just draw this in a day  by the way. You know  try making some charts like this at home. You gotta be accurate  There's measurement involved  increments. These are maps  by the way. Not stamps  but one day. Okay  I'm getting to the punch. Golden Ratio  it's crazy. And look at this  built within it is the Golden Ratio. I start looking at that  and look at them again. They start looking like planets. I go to JPL. I look at the orbits of the planets. I find    examples of it in our solar system. I never told anybody. This is the first thing. This could be history. Kepler was right. Eighteen and     the middle of the Moleeds   .    is the golden section. Multiply them together    .    x   .    is    .   . Which is .    different from the number of days in a year. Hey  you can't make this up. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. As a magician  I try to create images that make people stop and think. I also try to challenge myself to do things that doctors say are not possible. I was buried alive in New York City in a coffin  buried alive in a coffin in April        for a week. I lived there with nothing but water. And it ended up being so much fun that I decided I could pursue doing more of these things. The next one is I froze myself in a block of ice for three days and three nights in New York City. That one was way more difficult than I had expected. The one after that  I stood on top of a hundred foot pillar for    hours. I began to hallucinate so hard that the buildings that were behind me started to look like big animal heads. So  next I went to London. In London I lived in a glass box for    days with nothing but water. It was  for me  one of the most difficult things I'd ever done  but it was also the most beautiful. There was so many skeptics  especially the press in London  that they started flying cheeseburgers on helicopters around my box to tempt me. So  I felt very validated when the New England Journal of Medicine actually used the research for science. My next pursuit was I wanted to see how long I could go without breathing  like how long I could survive with nothing  not even air. I didn't realize that it would become the most amazing journey of my life. As a young magician  I was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges. So  I began  early on  competing against the other kids  seeing how long I could stay underwater while they went up and down to breathe  you know  five times  while I stayed under on one breath. By the time I was a teenager  I was able to hold my breath for three minutes and    seconds. I would later find out that was Houdini's personal record. In      I heard of a story about a boy that fell through ice and was trapped under a river. He was underneath  not breathing for    minutes. When the rescue workers came  they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage. His core temperature had dropped to    degrees. As a magician  I think everything is possible. And I think if something is done by one person  it can be done by others. I started to think  if the boy could survive without breathing for that long  there must be a way that I could do it. So  I met with a top neurosurgeon. And I asked him  how long is it possible to go without breathing  like how long could I go without air  And he said to me that anything over six minutes you have a serious risk of hypoxic brain damage. So  I took that as a challenge  basically. My first try  I figured that I could do something similar  and I created a water tank  and I filled it with ice and freezing cold water. And I stayed inside of that water tank hoping my core temperature would start to drop. And I was shivering. In my first attempt to hold my breath  I couldn't even last a minute. So  I realized that was completely not going to work. I went to talk to a doctor friend    and I asked him   How could I do that    I want to hold my breath for a really long time. How could it be done   And he said   David  you're a magician  create the illusion of not breathing  it will be much easier.  So  he came up with this idea of creating a rebreather  with a CO  scrubber  which was basically a tube from Home Depot  with a balloon duct taped to it  that he thought we could put inside of me  and somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe with this thing in me. This is a little hard to watch. But this is that attempt. So  that clearly wasn't going to work. Then I actually started thinking about liquid breathing. There is a chemical that's called perflubron. And it's so high in oxygen levels that in theory you could breathe it. So  I got my hands on that chemical  filled the sink up with it  and stuck my face in the sink and tried to breathe that in  which was really impossible. It's basically like trying to breathe  as a doctor said  while having an elephant standing on your chest. So  that idea disappeared. Then I started thinking  would it be possible to hook up a heart lung bypass machine and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery  and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood  Which was another insane idea  obviously. Then I thought about the craziest idea of all the ideas  to actually do it. To actually try to hold my breath past the point that doctors would consider you brain dead. So  I started researching into pearl divers. You know  because they go down for four minutes on one breath. And when I was researching pearl divers  I found the world of free diving. It was the most amazing thing that I ever discovered  pretty much. There is many different aspects to free diving. There is depth records  where people go as deep as they can. And then there is static apnea. That's holding your breath as long as you can in one place without moving. That was the one that I studied. The first thing that I learned is when you're holding your breath  you should never move at all  that wastes energy. And that depletes oxygen  and it builds up CO  in your blood. So  I learned never to move. And I learned how to slow my heart rate down. I had to remain perfectly still and just relax and think that I wasn't in my body  and just control that. And then I learned how to purge. Purging is basically hyperventilating. You blow in and out    You do that  you get lightheaded  you get tingling. And you're really ridding your body of CO . So  when you hold your breath  it's infinitely easier. Then I learned that you have to take a huge breath  and just hold and relax and never let any air out  and just hold and relax through all the pain. Every morning  this is for months  I would wake up and the first thing that I would do is I would hold my breath for  out of    minutes  I would hold my breath for    minutes. So  basically what that means is I would purge  I'd breathe really hard for a minute. And I would hold  immediately after  for five and a half minutes. Then I would breathe again for a minute  purging as hard as I can  then immediately after that I would hold again for five and a half minutes. I would repeat this process eight times in a row. Out of    minutes  you're only breathing for eight minutes. At the end of that you're completely fried  your brain. You feel like you're walking around in a daze. And you have these awful headaches. Basically  I'm not the best person to talk to when I'm doing that stuff. I started learning about the world record holder. His name is Tom Sietas. And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath. He's six foot four. He's     pounds. And his total lung capacity is twice the size of an average person. I'm six foot one  and fat. We'll say big boned. I had to drop    pounds in three months. So  everything that I put into my body  I considered as medicine. Every bit of food was exactly what it was for its nutritional value. I ate really small controlled portions throughout the day. And I started to really adapt my body.  Individual results may vary  The thinner I was  the longer I was able to hold my breath. And by eating so well and training so hard  my resting heart rate dropped to    beats per minute. Which is lower than most Olympic athletes. In four months of training  I was able to hold my breath for over seven minutes. I wanted to try holding my breath everywhere. I wanted to try it in the most extreme situations to see if I could slow my heart rate down under duress. I decided that I was going to break the world record live on prime time television. The world record was eight minutes and    seconds  held by Tom Sietas  that guy with the whale lungs I told you about. I assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln Center and if I stayed there a week not eating  I would get comfortable in that situation and I would slow my metabolism  which I was sure would help me hold my breath longer than I had been able to do it. I was completely wrong. I entered the sphere a week before the scheduled air date. And I thought everything seemed to be on track. Two days before my big breath hold attempt  for the record  the producers of my television special thought that just watching somebody holding their breath  and almost drowning  is too boring for television. So  I had to add handcuffs  while holding my breath  to escape from. This was a critical mistake. Because of the movement  I was wasting oxygen. And by seven minutes I had gone into these awful convulsions. By       I started to black out. And by seven minutes and    seconds  they had to pull my body out and bring me back. I had failed on every level. So  naturally  the only way out of the slump that I could think of was  I decided to call Oprah. I told her that I wanted to up the ante and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had. This was a different record. This was a pure O  static apnea record that Guinness had set the world record at    minutes. So  basically you breathe pure O  first  oxygenating your body  flushing out CO   and you are able to hold much longer. I realized that my real competition was the beaver. In January of '    Oprah gave me four months to prepare and train. So  I would sleep in a hypoxic tent every night. A hypoxic tent is a tent that simulates altitude at        feet. So  it's like base camp  Everest. What that does is  you start building up the red bloodcell count in your body  which helps you carry oxygen better. Every morning  again  after getting out of that tent  your brain is completely wiped out. My first attempt on pure O   I was able to go up to    minutes. So  it was a pretty big success. The neurosurgeon pulled me out of the water because in his mind  at    minutes your brain is done  you're brain dead. So  he pulled me up  and I was fine. There was one person there that was definitely not impressed. It was my ex girlfriend. While I was breaking the record underwater for the first time  she was sifting through my Blackberry  checking all my messages. My brother had a picture of it. It is really    I then announced that I was going to go for Sietas' record  publicly. And what he did in response  is he went on Regis and Kelly  and broke his old record. Then his main competitor went out and broke his record. So  he suddenly pushed the record up to    minutes and    seconds. Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared. It was longer than the record. I wanted to get the Science Times to document this. I wanted to get them to do a piece on it. So  I did what any person seriously pursuing scientific advancement would do. I walked into the New York Times offices and did card tricks to everybody. So  I don't know if it was the magic or the lure of the Cayman Islands  but John Tierney flew down and did a piece on the seriousness of breath holding. While he was there  I tried to impress him  of course. And I did a dive down to     feet  which is basically the height of a    story building  and as I was coming up  I blacked out underwater  which is really dangerous  that's how you drown. Luckily  Kirk had seen me and he swam over and pulled me up. So  I started full focus. I completely trained to get my breath hold time up for what I needed to do. But there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it  being on Oprah. But in practice  I would do it face down  floating on the pool. But for TV they wanted me to be upright so they could see my face  basically. The other problem was the suit was so buoyant that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up. So  I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose  which was a real problem for me. That made me extremely nervous  raising the heart rate. Then  what they also did was  which we never did before  is there was a heart rate monitor. And it was right next to the sphere. So  every time my heart would beat  I'd hear the beep beep beep beep  you know  the ticking  really loud. Which was making me more nervous. And there was no way to slow my heart rate down. Normally  I would start at    beats per minute  and while holding my breath  it would drop to    beats per minute  which is pretty unusual. This time it started at     beats  and it never went down. I spent the first five minutes underwater desperately trying to slow my heart rate down. I was just sitting there thinking   I've got to slow this down. I'm going to fail.  And I was getting more nervous. And the heart rate just kept going up and up  all the way up to     beats. Basically it's the same thing that created my downfall at Lincoln Center. It was a waste of O . When I made it to the halfway mark  at eight minutes  I was     percent certain that I was not going to be able to make this. There was no way for me to do it. I figured  Oprah had dedicated an hour to doing this breath hold thing  if I had cracked early  it would be a whole show about how depressed I am. So  I figured I'm better off just fighting and staying there until I black out  at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that. I kept pushing to    minutes. At    minutes you start getting all these really strong tingling sensations in your fingers and toes. And I knew that that was blood shunting  when the blood rushes away from your extremities to provide oxygen to your vital organs. At    minutes I started feeling throbbing sensations in my legs  and my lips started to feel really strange. At minute    I started to have ringing in my ears  and I started to feel my arm going numb. And I'm a hypochondriac  and I remember arm numb means heart attack. So  I started to really get really paranoid. Then at    minutes  maybe because of the hypochondria  I started feeling pains all over my chest. It was awful. At    minutes  I had these awful contractions  like this urge to breathe. At    minutes I was suffering major O  deprivation to the heart. And I started having ischemia to the heart. My heartbeat would go from     to     to      to     to     to     again. It would skip a beat. It would start. It would stop. And I felt all this. And I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack. So  at    minutes what I did is I slid my feet out because I knew that if I did go out  if I did have a heart attack  they'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet out before pulling me up. I was really nervous. I let my feet out  and I started floating to the top. And I didn't take my head out. But I was just floating there waiting for my heart to stop  just waiting. They had doctors with the  Pst   you know  sitting there waiting. And then suddenly I hear screaming. And I think that there is some weird thing    that I had died or something had happened. And then I realized that I had made it to      . So  with the energy of everybody that was there  I decided to keep pushing. And I went to    minutes and four seconds. As though that wasn't enough  what I did immediately after is I went to Quest Labs and had them take every blood sample that they could to test for everything and to see where my levels were  so the doctors could use it  once again. I also didn't want anybody to question it. I had the world record and I wanted to make sure it was legitimate. So  I get to New York City the next day  I'm walking out of the Apple store  and this kid walks up to me he's like   Yo  D   I'm like  Yeah   He said   If you really held your breath that long  why'd you come out of the water dry   I was like  What   And that's my life. So    As a magician  I try to show things to people that seem impossible. And I think magic  whether I'm holding my breath or shuffling a deck of cards  is pretty simple. It's practice  it's training  and it's     Sobs  It's practice  it's training and experimenting  while pushing through the pain to be the best that I can be. And that's what magic is to me  so  thank you. Right now is the most exciting time to see new Indian art. Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world like never before. I thought it might be interesting  even for the many long time collectors here with us at TED  local collectors  to have an outside view of    young Indian artists I wish everyone at TED to know. The first is Bharti Kher. The central motif of Bharti's practice is the ready made store bought bindi that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads  every day  in an act closely associated with the institution of marriage. But originally the significance of the bindi is to symbolize the third eye between the spiritual world and the religious world. Bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche  as she calls it  by exploding it into something spectacular. She also creates life size fiberglass sculptures  often of animals  which she then completely covers in bindis  often with potent symbolism. She says she first got started with    packets of bindis  and then wondered what she could do with    thousand. Our next artist  Balasubramaniam  really stands at the crossroads of sculpture  painting and installation  working wonders with fiberglass. Since Bala himself will be speaking at TED I won't spend too much time on him here today  except to say that he really succeeds at making the invisible visible. Brooklyn based Chitra Ganesh is known for her digital collages  using Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas as her primary source material. These comics are a fundamental way that children  especially in the diaspora  learn their religious and mythological folk tales. I  for one  was steeped in these. Chitra basically remixes and re titles these iconic images to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics embedded in these deeply influential comics. And she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well. Jitish Kallat successfully practices across photography  sculpture  painting and installation. As you can see  he's heavily influenced by graffiti and street art  and his home city of Mumbai is an ever present element in his work. He really captures that sense of density and energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay. He also creates phantasmagoric sculptures made of bones from cast resin. Here he envisions the carcass of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot. This next artist  N.S. Harsha  actually has a studio right here in Mysore. He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition. He creates these fine  delicate images which he then repeats on a massive scale. He uses scale to more and more spectacular effect  whether on the roof of a temple in Singapore  or in his increasingly ambitious installation work  here with     functioning sewing machines  fabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations. Mumbai based Dhruvi Acharya builds on her love of comic books and street art to comment on the roles and expectations of modern Indian women. She too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas  but in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh. In this particular work  she actually strips out the images and leaves the actual text to reveal something previously unseen  and provocative. Raqib Shaw is Kolkata born  Kashmir raised  and London trained. He too is reinventing the miniature tradition. He creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch  but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth. He actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect. I'm kind of cheating with this next artist since Raqs Media Collective are really three artists working together. Raqs are probably the foremost practitioners of multimedia art in India today  working across photography  video and installation. They frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization  and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work. Here  they invite the viewer to analyze a crime looking at evidence and clues embedded in five narratives on these five different screens  in which the city itself may have been the culprit. This next artist is probably the alpha male of contemporary Indian art  Subodh Gupta. He was first known for creating giant photo realistic canvases  paintings of everyday objects  the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers known to every Indian. He celebrates these local and mundane objects globally  and on a grander and grander scale  by incorporating them into ever more colossal sculptures and installations. And finally number     last and certainly not least  Ranjani Shettar  who lives and works here in the state of Karnataka  creates ethereal sculptures and installations that really marry the organic to the industrial  and brings  like Subodh  the local global. These are actually wires wrapped in muslin and steeped in vegetable dye. And she arranges them so that the viewer actually has to navigate through the space  and interact with the objects. And light and shadow are a very important part of her work. She also explores themes of consumerism  and the environment  such as in this work  where these basket like objects look organic and woven  and are woven  but with the strips of steel  salvaged from cars that she found in a Bangalore junkyard.    artists  six minutes  I know that was a lot to take in. But I can only hope I've whet your appetite to go out and see and learn more about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today. Thank you very much for looking and listening. This is actually a painting that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School. And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted. In the front  you see  actually  Joe Murray getting the patient ready for the transplant  while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison  the Chief of Urology at Harvard  actually harvesting the kidney. The kidney was indeed the first organ ever to be transplanted to the human. That was back in          years ago. Yet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges as many decades ago. Certainly many advances  many lives saved. But we have a major shortage of organs. In the last decade the number of patients waiting for a transplant has doubled. While  at the same time  the actual number of transplants has remained almost entirely flat. That really has to do with our aging population. We're just getting older. Medicine is doing a better job of keeping us alive. But as we age  our organs tend to fail more. So  that's a challenge  not just for organs but also for tissues. Trying to replace pancreas  trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's. These are major issues. This is actually a very stunning statistic. Every    seconds a patient dies from diseases that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement. So  what can we do about it  We've talked about stem cells tonight. That's a way to do it. But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients  in terms of actual therapies for organs. Wouldn't it be great if our bodies could regenerate  Wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power of our bodies  to actually heal ourselves  It's not really that foreign of a concept  actually  it happens on the Earth every day. This is actually a picture of a salamander. Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate. You see here a little video. This is actually a limb injury in this salamander. And this is actually real photography  timed photography  showing how that limb regenerates in a period of days. You see the scar form. And that scar actually grows out a new limb. So  salamanders can do it. Why can't we  Why can't humans regenerate  Actually  we can regenerate. Your body has many organs and every single organ in your body has a cell population that's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day. As you age  as you get older. Your bones regenerate every    years. Your skin regenerates every two weeks. So  your body is constantly regenerating. The challenge occurs when there is an injury. At the time of injury or disease  the body's first reaction is to seal itself off from the rest of the body. It basically wants to fight off infection  and seal itself  whether it's organs inside your body  or your skin  the first reaction is for scar tissue to move in  to seal itself off from the outside. So  how can we harness that power  One of the ways that we do that is actually by using smart biomaterials. How does this work  Well  on the left side here you see a urethra which was injured. This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body. And you see that it is injured. We basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials that you can actually use as a bridge. If you build that bridge  and you close off from the outside environment  then you can create that bridge  and cells that regenerate in your body  can then cross that bridge  and take that path. That's exactly what you see here. It's actually a smart biomaterial that we used  to actually treat this patient. This was an injured urethra on the left side. We used that biomaterial in the middle. And then  six months later on the right hand side you see this reengineered urethra. Turns out your body can regenerate  but only for small distances. The maximum efficient distance for regeneration is only about one centimeter. So  we can use these smart biomaterials but only for about one centimeter to bridge those gaps. So  we do regenerate  but for limited distances. What do we do now  if you have injury for larger organs  What do we do when we have injuries for structures which are much larger than one centimeter  Then we can start to use cells. The strategy here  is if a patient comes in to us with a diseased or injured organ  you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ  less than half the size of a postage stamp  you can then tease that tissue apart  and look at its basic components  the patient's own cells  you take those cells out  grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities  and then we then use scaffold materials. To the naked eye they look like a piece of your blouse  or your shirt  but actually these materials are fairly complex and they are designed to degrade once inside the body. It disintegrates a few months later. It's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle. It's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing the cells to regenerate new tissue  and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away. And that's what we did for this piece of muscle. This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through the structures to actually engineer the muscle. We take the cells  we expand them  we place the cells on the scaffold  and we then place the scaffold back into the patient. But actually  before placing the scaffold into the patient  we actually exercise it. We want to make sure that we condition this muscle  so that it knows what to do once we put it into the patient. That's what you're seeing here. You're seeing this muscle bio reactor actually exercising the muscle back and forth. Okay. These are flat structures that we see here  the muscle. What about other structures  This is actually an engineered blood vessel. Very similar to what we just did  but a little bit more complex. Here we take a scaffold  and we basically    scaffold can be like a piece of paper here. And we can then tubularize this scaffold. And what we do is we  to make a blood vessel  same strategy. A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types. We take muscle cells  we paste  or coat the outside with these muscle cells  very much like baking a layer cake  if you will. You place the muscle cells on the outside. You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside. You now have your fully seeded scaffold. You're going to place this in an oven like device. It has the same conditions as a human body     degrees centigrade     percent oxygen. You then exercise it  as what you saw on that tape. And on the right you actually see a carotid artery that was engineered. This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain. And this is an X ray showing you the patent  functional blood vessel. More complex structures such as blood vessels  urethras  which I showed you  they're definitely more complex because you're introducing two different cell types. But they are really acting mostly as conduits. You're allowing fluid or air to go through at steady states. They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs. Hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity  because you're asking these organs to act on demand. So  the bladder is one such organ. Same strategy  we take a very small piece of the bladder  less than half the size of a postage stamp. We then tease the tissue apart into its two individual cell components  muscle  and these bladder specialized cells. We grow the cells outside the body in large quantities. It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ. We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder. We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells. We coat the outside with these muscle cells. We place it back into this oven like device. From the time you take that piece of tissue  six to eight weeks later you can put the organ right back into the patient. This actually shows the scaffold. The material is actually being coated with the cells. When we did the first clinical trial for these patients we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient. We brought patients in  six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery  did X rays  and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient's size pelvic cavity. For the second phase of the trials we just had different sizes  small  medium  large and extra large. It's true. And I'm sure everyone here wanted an extra large. Right  So  bladders are definitely a little bit more complex than the other structures. But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it. This is actually a heart valve  which we engineered. And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy. We take the scaffold  we seed it with cells  and you can now see here  the valve leaflets opening and closing. We exercise these prior to implantation. Same strategy. And then the most complex are the solid organs. For solid organs  they're more complex because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter. This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear. It's now being seeded with cartilage. That's the oven like device  once it's coated it gets placed there. And then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold. This is actually digits that we're engineering. These are being layered  one layer at a time  first the bone  we fill in the gaps with cartilage. We then start adding the muscle on top. And you start layering these solid structures. Again  fairly more complex organs  but by far  the most complex solid organs are actually the vascularized  highly vascularized  a lot of blood vessel supply  organs such as the heart  the liver  the kidneys. This is actually an example    several strategies to engineer solid organs. This is actually one of the strategies. We use a printer. And instead of using ink  we use    you just saw an inkjet cartridge    we just use cells. This is actually your typical desktop printer. It's actually printing this two chamber heart  one layer at a time. You see the heart coming out there. It takes about    minutes to print  and about four to six hours later you see the muscle cells contract. This technology was developed by Tao Ju  who worked at our institute. And this is actually still  of course  experimental  not for use in patients. Another strategy that we have followed is actually to use decellularized organs. We actually take donor organs  organs that are discarded  and we then can use very mild detergents to take all the cell elements out of these organs. So  for example on the left panel  top panel  you see a liver. We actually take the donor liver  we use very mild detergents  and we  by using these mild detergents  we take all the cells out of the liver. Two weeks later  we basically can lift this organ up  it feels like a liver  we can hold it like a liver  it looks like a liver  but it has no cells. All we are left with is the skeleton  if you will  of the liver  all made up of collagen  a material that's in our bodies  that will not reject. We can use it from one patient to the next. We then take this vascular structure and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply. You can see  actually that's a fluoroscopy. We're actually injecting contrast into the organ. Now you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ into this decellularized liver. And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact. We then take the cells  the vascular cells  blood vessel cells  we perfuse the vascular tree with the patient's own cells. We perfuse the outside of the liver with the patient's own liver cells. And we can then create functional livers. And that's actually what you're seeing. This is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality of the liver structure  experimentally. For the kidney  as I talked to you about the first painting that you saw  the first slide I showed you     percent of the patients on the transplant wait list are waiting for a kidney     percent. So  another strategy we're following is actually to create wafers that we stack together  like an accordion  if you will. So  we stack these wafers together  using the kidney cells. And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered. They are actually making urine. Again  small structures  our challenge is how to make them larger  and that is something we're working on right now at the institute. One of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then is what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine. If at all possible  we really would like to use smart biomaterials that we can just take off the shelf and regenerate your organs. We are limited with distances right now  but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time. If we cannot use smart biomaterials  then we'd rather use your very own cells. Why  Because they will not reject. We can take cells from you  create the structure  put it right back into you  they will not reject. And if possible  we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ. If you present with a diseased wind pipe we'd like to take cells from your windpipe. If you present with a diseased pancreas we'd like to take cells from that organ. Why  Because we'd rather take those cells which already know that those are the cell types you want. A windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell. We don't need to teach it to become another cell type. So  we prefer organ specific cells. And today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body  except for several which we still need stem cells for  like heart  liver  nerve and pancreas. And for those we still need stem cells. If we cannot use stem cells from your body then we'd like to use donor stem cells. And we prefer cells that will not reject and will not form tumors. And we're working a lot with the stem cells that we published on two years ago  stem cells from the amniotic fluid  and the placenta  which have those properties. So  at this point  I do want to tell you that some of the major challenges we have. You know  I just showed you this presentation  everything looks so good  everything works. Actually no  these technologies really are not that easy. Some of the work you saw today was performed by over     researchers at our institute across a    year time span. So  these are very tough technologies. Once you get the formula right you can replicate it. But it takes a lot to get there. So  I always like to show this cartoon. This is how to stop a runaway stage. And there you see the stagecoach driver  and he goes  on the top panel  He goes A  B  C  D  E  F. He finally stops the runaway stage. And those are usually the basic scientists  The bottom is usually the surgeons. I'm a surgeon so that's not that funny. But actually method A is the correct approach. And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies to the clinic  we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can in the laboratory before we ever launch these technologies to patients. And when we launch these technologies to patients we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question. Are you ready to place this in your own loved one  your own child  your own family member  and then we proceed. Because our main goal  of course  is first  to do no harm. I'm going to show you now  a very short clip  It's a five second clip of a patient who received one of the engineered organs. We started implanting some of these structures over    years ago. So  we have patients now walking around with organs  engineered organs  for over    years  as well. I'm going to show a clip of one young lady. She had a spina bifida defect  a spinal cord abnormality. She did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN. We are just taking five seconds. This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of. Video  Kaitlyn M  I'm happy. I was always afraid that I was going to have like  an accident or something. And now I can just go and go out with my friends  go do whatever I want. Anthony Atala  See  at the end of the day  the promise of regenerative medicine is a single promise. And that is really very simple  to make our patients better. Thank you for your attention. Can geographic information make you healthy  In      I got hit by a train. My train was a heart attack. I found myself in a hospital in an intensive care ward  recuperating from emergency surgery. And I suddenly realized something  that I was completely in the dark. I started asking my questions   Well  why me    Why now    Why here    Could my doctor have warned me   So  what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health. Genetics  lifestyle and environment. That's going to sort of contain our risks  and if we manage those risks we're going to live a good life and a good healthy life. Well  I understand the genetics and lifestyle part. And you know why I understand that  Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this. Have you ever had to fill out those long  legal size forms in your doctor's office  I mean  if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once  right  Do it over and over again. And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history  your medication history  your surgical history  your allergy history ... did I forget any history  But this part of the equation I didn't really get  and I don't think my physicians really get this part of the equation. What does that mean  my environment  Well  it can mean a lot of things. This is my life. These are my life places. We all have these. While I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about  How many places have you lived  Just think about that  you know  wander through your life thinking about this. And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places. You spend it at rest and you spend it at work. And if you're like me  you're in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place. So  it's not really simple when somebody asks you   Where do you live  where do you work  and where do you spend all your time  And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don't even see   Well  when I have done this on myself  I always come to the conclusion that I spend about    percent of my time relatively in a small number of places. And I don't wander far from that place for a majority of my time  even though I'm an extensive global trekker. Now  I'm going to take you on a little journey here. I started off in Scranton  Pennsylvania. I don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania  but this is where I spent my first    years with my little young lungs. You know  breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide  carbon dioxide and methane gas  in unequal quantities       years of this. And if you've been in that part of the country  this is what those piles of burning  smoldering coal waste look like. So then I decided to leave that part of the world  and I was going to go to the mid west. OK  so I ended up in Louisville  Kentucky. Well  I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown. They manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene. Okay  I spent    years  in my middle age lungs now  breathing various concentrations of that. And on a clear day it always looked like this  so you never saw it. It was insidious and it was really happening. Then I decided I had to get really smart  I would take this job in the West Coast. And I moved to Redlands California. Very nice  and there my older  senior lungs  as I like to call them  I filled with particulate matter  carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone. Okay  Almost like the highest in the nation. Alright  this is what it looks like on a good day. If you've been there  you know what I'm talking about. So  what's wrong with this picture  Well  the picture is  there is a huge gap here. The one thing that never happens in my doctor's office  They never ask me about my place history. No doctor  can I remember  ever asking me   Where have you lived   They haven't asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach. They really don't do that. It's missing. Look at the kind of data that's available. This data's from all over the world    countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research. Now  I've circled the places where I've been. Well  by design  if I wanted to have a heart attack I'd been in the right places. Right  So  how many people are in the white  How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space  Anybody  Boy you're lucky. How many have spent it in the red places  Oh  not so lucky. There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world. They give us some sense of what's going to be our train wreck. But none of that's in my medical record. And it's not in yours either. So  here's my friend Paul. He's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours            days out of the year for the last two years  everywhere he went. And you can see he's been to a few places around the United States. And this is where he has spent most of his time. If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do. Anybody got any clues  Ski. Right. We can zoom in here  and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time. And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA. Did you know that data existed  For every community in the United States  you could have your own personalized map of that. So  our cell phones can now build a place history. This is how Paul did it. He did it with his iPhone. This might be what we end up with. This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right  This could be my little assessment. And he looks at that and he says   Whoa Bill  I suggest that maybe you not decide  just because you're out here in beautiful California  and it's warm every day  that you get out and run at six o'clock at night. I'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill  because of this report.  What I'd like to leave you for are two prescriptions. Okay  number one is  we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information. It's called geomedicine. There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this. And they're in the early stages of development. These programs need to be supported  and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I've shared here with you today. The second thing we need to do is while we're spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record  we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record. It not only will be important for the physician  it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon. But it will also be useful for us. I could have made the decision  if I had this information  not to move to the ozone capital of the United States  couldn't I  I could make that decision. Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company. With that  I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost    years ago. Just look at that for a minute. That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about  was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease  in illness  in wellness  and how our healthcare system actually operates. That was what he was talking about on that quote. And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago. So  I'd very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records. So with that  I'll leave you that in my particular view of view of health  Geography always matters. And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy. Thank you. I'm going to speak to you today about architectural agency. What I mean by that is that it's time for architecture to do things again  not just represent things. This is a construction helmet that I received two years ago at the groundbreaking of the largest project I  and my firm  have ever been involved in. I was thrilled to get it. I was thrilled to be the only person standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet. I thought it represented the importance of the architect. I stayed thrilled until I got home  threw the helmet onto my bed  fell down onto my bed and realized inside there was an inscription. Now  I think that this is a great metaphor for the state of architecture and architects today. We are for decorative purposes only. Now  who do we have to blame  We can only blame ourselves. Over the last    years the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex and has gotten much more litigious. And we architects are cowards. So  as we have faced liability  we have stepped back and back  and unfortunately  where there is liability  guess what there is  power. So  eventually we have found ourselves in a totally marginalized position  way over here. Now  what did we do  We're cowards  but we're smart cowards. And so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture. And we announced   Hey  architecture  it's over here  in this autonomous language we're going to seed control of processes.  And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession. We actually created an artificial schism between creation and execution  as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute and as if you could actually execute without knowing how to create. Now  something else happened. And that's when we began to sell the world that architecture was created by individuals creating genius sketches. And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches for years and years and years is not only something to be derided  but we would merely write it off as merely execution. Now I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating that    minutes of copulation is the creative act  and nine months of gestation  and  God forbid     hours of child labor is merely execution. So  what do we architects need to do  We need to stitch back creation and execution. And we need to start authoring processes again instead of authoring objects. Now  if we do this  I believe we can go back    years and start reinjecting agency  social engineering  back into architecture. Now  there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do  like managing contracts  learning how to write contracts  understanding procurement processes  understanding the time value of money and cost estimation. But I'm going to reduce this to the beginning of the process  into three very pedantic statements. The first is  Take core positions with your client. I know it's shocking  right  that architecture would actually say that. The second position is  Actually take positions. Take joint positions with your client. This is the moment in which you as the architect and your client can begin to inject vision and agency. But it has to be done together. And then only after this is done are you allowed to do this  begin to put forward architectural manifestations that manifest those positions. And both owner and architect alike are empowered to critique those manifestations based on the positions that you've taken. Now  I believe that one really amazing thing will happen if you do this. I'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control. You do not know what the end result is. But I promise you  with enough brain power and enough passion and enough commitment  you will arrive at conclusions that will transcend convention  and will simply be something that you could not have initially or individually conceived of. Alright  now I'm going to reduce all of this to a series of simple dumb sketches. This is the modus operandi that we have today. We roll     foot Spartan  i.e. our vision  up to our clients' gates of Troy. And we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right  Well  how about instead of doing that  we roll up to the gates something they want. Now this is a little bit of a dangerous metaphor  because of course we all know that inside of the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears. So  we can change the metaphor. Let's call the Trojan Horse the vessel by which you get through the gate  get through the constraints of a project. At which point  you and your client have the ability to start considering what you're going to put inside that vessel  the agency  the vision. And if you do that  you do that responsibly  I believe that instead of delivering Spartans  you can deliver maidens. And if I could summarize that all up into one single sketch it would be this. If we are so good at our craft shouldn't we be able to conceive of an architectural manifestation that slides seamlessly through the project's and the client's constraints  Now  with that in mind  I'm going to show a project that's very dear to many people in this room   well  maybe not dear  but certainly close to many people in this room. And that's a project that is just about to open next week  the new home for the Dallas Theater Center  the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre. Now  I'm going to present it on the same terms  issue  position and architectural manifestation. Now  the first issue that we faced was that the Dallas Theater Center had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect of some place outside of the triumvirate of New York  Chicago and Seattle. And this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership. But it also had to do with something rather unusual  and that was this horrible little building that they'd been performing in. Why was this horrible little building so important to their renown and their innovation  Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building. When you're on Broadway  you cannot tear the proscenium down. This building  when an artistic director wanted to do a  Cherry Orchard  and wanted people and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage  they brought a backhoe in  and they simply dug the hole. Well  that's exciting. And you can start to get the best artistic directors  scenic designers and actors from around the country to come to perform here because you can do things you can't do elsewhere. So  the first position we took was   Hey  we as architects had better not show up and do a pristine building that doesn't engender the same freedoms that this old dilapidated shed provided the company.  The second issue is a nuance of the first. And that's that the company and the building was multiform. That meant that they were able to perform  as long as they had labor they were able to go between proscenium  thrust  flat floor  arena  traverse  you name it. All they needed was labor. Well  something happened. In fact something happened to all institutions around the world. It started to become hard to raise operational costs  operational budgets. So  they stopped having inexpensive labor. And eventually they had to freeze their organization into something called a bastardized thruscenium. So  the second position we took is that the freedoms that we provided  the ability to move between stage configurations  had better be able to be done without relying on operational costs. Alright  Affordably. The architectural manifestation was frankly just dumb. It was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house and redefine them as above house and below house. At first blush you think   Hey it's crazy  what could you possibly gain   We created what we like to call superfly. Now  superfly  the concept is you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower  and you smear them across flytower and auditorium. Suddenly the artistic director can move between different stage and audience configurations. And because that flytower has the ability to pick up all the pristine elements  suddenly the rest of the environment can be provisional. And you can drill  cut  nail  screw paint and replace  with a minimum of cost. But there was a third advantage that we got by doing this move that was unexpected. And that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium in a most unusual way. And that provided the artistic director suddenly the ability to define suspension of disbelief. So  the building affords artistic directors the freedom to conceive of almost any kind of activity underneath this floating object. But also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief such that in the last act of Macbeth  if he or she wants you to associate the parable that you're seeing with Dallas  with your real life  he or she can do so. Now  in order to do this we and the clients had to do something fairly remarkable. In fact it really was the clients who had to do it. They had to make a decision  based on the positions we took to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital A architecture and one third infrastructure  to actually the inverse  two thirds infrastructure and one third capital A architecture. That's a lot for a client to commit to before you actually see the fruition of the concept. But based on the positions  they took the educated leap of faith to do so. And effectively we created what we like to call a theater machine. Now  that theater machine has ability to move between a whole series of configurations at the push of a button and a few stagehands in a short amount of time. But it also has the potential to not only provide multiform but multi processional sequences. Meaning  The artistic director doesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby. One of the things that we learned when we visited various theaters is they hate us architects  because they say the first thing they have to do  the first five minutes of any show  is they have to get our architecture out of the mind of their patron. Well now there are potentials of this building to allow the artistic director to actually move into the building without using our architecture. So  in fact  there is the building  there is what we call the draw. You're going down into our lobby  go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits  whether you like them or not  up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium. But there is also the potential to allow people to move directly from the outside  in this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance  into the interior of the auditorium. And here is the fruition of that in actuality. These are the two large pivoting doors that allow people to move directly from the outside  in or from the inside  out  performers or audience alike. Now  imagine what that could be. I have to say honestly this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long. But imagine the freedoms if you could take this further  that in fact you could consider a Wagnerian entry  a first act in thrust  an intermission in Greek  a second act in arena  and you leave through our lobby with dangly bits. Now that  I would say  is architecture performing. It is taking the hand of the architect to actually remove the hand of the architect in favor of the hand of the artistic director. I'll go through the three basic configurations. This is the flat floor configuration. You notice that there is no proscenium  the balconies have been raised up  there are no seats  the floor in the auditorium is flat. The first configuration is easy to understand. The balconies come down  you see that the orchestra begins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage  and the seats come in. The third configuration is a little harder to understand. Here you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way in order to bring a thrust into the space. And some of the seats need to actually change their direction  and change their rake  to allow that to happen. I'll do it again so you can see it. There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium. And there it is in the thrust configuration. In order to do that  again  we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks. And they told us one important thing   You shall not beta test.  Meaning  nothing that we do can we be the first ones to do it. But they were willing for us to apply technologies from other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building. And the solution in terms of the balconies was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift. Now  if you were to take a scoreboard and drop it on dirt and whiskey  that would be bad. If you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena and be able to do the Ice Capades the next night  that would also be bad. And so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms and allowed the theater and our client to actually do this with confidence that they would be able to change over their configurations at will. The second technology that we applied was actually using things that you know from the stage side of an opera house. In this case what we're doing is we're taking the orchestra floor  lifting it up  spinning it  changing the rake  taking it back to flat floor  changing the rake again. In essence  you can begin to define rakes and viewing angles of people in the orchestra seating  at will. Here you see the chairs being spun around to go from proscenium or end stage to thrust configuration. The proscenium  also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space. Here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium. And ultimately  up in the flytower  the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur. As I said  all that was in service of creating a flexible yet affordable configuration. But we got this other benefit  and that was the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage Dallas on the outside. Here you see the building in its current state with blinds closed. This is a trompe l'oeil. Actually this is not a curtain. These are vinyl blinds that are integrated into the windows themselves  again with failsafe mechanisms that can be lifted such that you can completely demystify  if you chose  the operations of the theater going on behind  rehearsals and so forth. But you also have the ability to allow the audience to see Dallas  to perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance. Now  if I'll take you through    this is an early concept sketch    take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together. Effectively you would have something like this. You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber   Aida   their elephants  you can bring the elephants in. You would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas or vice versa  Dallas to the auditorium. You'd be able to open portions in order to change the procession  allow people to come in and out for an intermission  or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance. As I said  all the balconies can move  but they can also be disappeared completely. The proscenium can fly. You can bring large objects into the chamber itself. But most convincingly when we had to confront the idea of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure  is something that is represented by this. And again  this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built  but at least suggests the ideas. This building has the ability  in short order  to go back to a flat floor organization such that they can rent it out. Now  if there is anyone here from American Airlines  please consider doing your Christmas party here. That allows the company to raise operational budgets without having to compete with other venues with much larger auditoriums. That's an enormous benefit. So  the theater company has the ability to do totally hermetic  light controlled  sound controlled  great acoustics  great intimacy Shakespeare  but can also do Beckett with the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it. Here it is in a flat floor configuration. The theater has been going through its kind of paces. Here it is in an end stage configuration. It's actually beautiful. There was a rock band. We stood outside trying to see if the acoustics worked  and you could see the guys doing this but you couldn't hear them. It was very unusual. Here it is in a thrust configuration. And last but not least  you see this already has the ability to create events in order to generate operational budgets to overcome the building in fact performing to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem. I'm going to show you a brief time lapse. As I said  this can be done with only two people  and with a minimum amount of time. This is the first time that actually the changeover was done and so there is literally thousands of people because everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it. So  in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around. And think of it being done with just a few people. Again  just a couple people are required. I promise. Et voila. So  just in conclusion  a few shots. This is the AT T Performing Arts Center's Dee and Charles Wyly Theater. There it is at night. And last but not least the entire AT T Performing Arts Center. You can see the Winspear Opera House on the right and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left. And to remind you that here is an example in which architecture actually did something. But we got to that conclusion without understanding where we were going  what we knew were a series of issues that the company and the client was confronted with. And we took positions with them  and it was through those positions that we began to take architectural manifestations and we arrived at a conclusion that none of us  really none of us could ever have conceived of initially or individually. Thank you. Namaste. Good morning. I'm very happy to be here in India. And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last particularly    years with V Day and  The Vagina Monologues   traveling the world  essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women. What I want to talk about today is this particular cell  or grouping of cells  that is in each and every one of us. And I want to call it the girl cell. And it's in men as well as in women. I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race. And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell  the oppression of these cells  the reinterpretation of these cells  the undermining of these cells  getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing  eradicating  destroying  reducing these cells  basically began the process of killing off the girl cell  which was  by the way  patriarchy. I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness. And it is essential to balance  to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us. And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion  and it's empathy  and it's passion itself  and it's vulnerability  and it's openness  and it's intensity  and it's association  and it's relationship  and it is intuitive. And then let's think how compassion informs wisdom  and that vulnerability is our greatest strength  and that emotions have inherent logic  which lead to radical  appropriate  saving action. And then let's remember that we've been taught the exact opposite by the powers that be  that compassion clouds your thinking  that it gets in the way  that vulnerability is weakness  that emotions are not to be trusted  and you're not supposed to take things personally  which is one of my favorites. I think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl. How do we bring up boys  What does it mean to be a boy  To be a boy really means not to be a girl. To be a man means not to be a girl. To be a woman means not to be a girl. To be strong means not to be a girl. To be a leader means not to be a girl. I actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we've had to train everyone not to be that. And I'd also like to say that the irony of course  is that denying girl  suppressing girl  suppressing emotion  refusing feeling has lead thus here. Where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence  the most horrific poverty  genocide  mass rapes  the destruction of the Earth  is completely out of control. And because we have suppressed our girl cells and suppressed our girl ship  we do not feel what is going on. So  we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening. I want to talk a little bit about the Democratic Republic of Congo. For me  it was the turning point of my life. I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years. I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world  a lot of violence. I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last    years. But the Democratic Republic of Congo really was the turning point in my soul. I went and I spent time in a place called Bukavu in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital  with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met. His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege. In the Congo  for those of you who don't know  there has been a war raging for the last    years  a war that has killed nearly six million people. It is estimated that somewhere between         and         women have been raped there. When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital I sat with women who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories. Their stories were so horrific  and so mind blowing and so on the other side of human existence  that to be perfectly honest with you  I was shattered. And I will tell you that what happened is through that shattering  listening to the stories of eight year old girls who had their insides eviscerated  who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes  literally  inside them where their pee and poop came out of them. Listening to the story of    year old women who were tied to chains and circled  and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically  all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them. My mind was so shattered. But what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way I have never been emboldened. That shattering  that opening of my girl cell  that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous  and braver  and actually more clever than I had been in the past in my life. I want to say that I think the powers that be know that empire building is actually    that feelings get in the way of empire building. Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth  and excavating the Earth  and destroying things. I remember  for example  when my father  who was very  very violent  used to beat me. And he would actually say  while he was beating me   Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry.  Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him. And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded of what he was doing. I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell. And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women. And I think in some ways we've been much harsher to men in the annihilation of their girl cell. I see how boys have been brought up  and I see this across the planet  to be tough  to be hardened  to distance themselves from their tenderness  to not cry. I actually realized once in Kosovo  when I watched a man break down  that bullets are actually hardened tears  that when we don't allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability  and have their compassion  and have their hearts  that they become hardened and hurtful and violent. And I think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure  to pretend they know things when they don't know things  or why would we be where we are  To pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess. And I will tell you a very funny story. On my way here on the airplane  I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane. And all these men  literally at least    men  were in their little seats watching chick flicks. And they were all alone  and I thought   This is the secret life of men.  I've traveled  as I said  to many  many countries  and I've seen  if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it's horrific to think what we do to girls in the world. And we heard from Sunitha yesterday  and Kavita about what we do to girls. But I just want to say that I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns  who are literally being treated like ashtrays. I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans. I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles. I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves. I've seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them illiterate  or we make them feel bad about being too smart. We silence them. We make them feel guilty for being smart. We get them to behave  to tone it down  not to be too intense. We sell them  we kill them as embryos  we enslave them  we rape them. We are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually objectified them and turned them into commodities. The selling of girls is rampant across the planet. And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows. But I also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of    to     they are they key  really  in the developing world  as well as in the whole world  to the future of humanity. And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be  including lack of access to healthcare  education  healthy foods  labor force participation. The burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings  which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers. The state of girls  the condition of girls  will  in my belief    and that's the girl inside us and the girl in the world    determine whether the species survives. And what I want to suggest is that  having talked to girls  because I just finished a new book called  I Am an Emotional Creature  The Secret Life of Girls Around the World   I've been talking to girls for five years  and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere is that the verb that's been enforced on girl is the verb  to please.  Girls are trained to please. I want to change the verb. I want us all to change the verb. I want the verb to be  educate   or  activate   or  engage   or  confront   or  defy   or  create.  If we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them. And I have to now share a few stories of girls I've seen across the planet who have engaged their girl  who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them. I know a    year old girl in the Netherlands  for example  who is demanding that she take a boat and go around the entire world by herself. There is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed    stars tattooed on the right side of her face. There is a girl  Julia Butterfly Hill  who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks. There is a girl who I met    years ago in Afghanistan who I have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary. And this girl  when she was    years old  wore a burqa in Afghanistan  and went into the stadiums and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women  underneath her burqa  with a video. And that video became the video that went out all over the world after      to show what was going on in Afghanistan. I want to talk about Rachel Corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank to say   End the occupation.  And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank. And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently in Bukavu  who was impregnated by her rapist. And she was holding her baby. And I asked her if she loved her baby. And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said   Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby  It's my baby and it's full of love.  The capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels  to me  is mind blowing. There is a girl named Dorcas  and I just met her in Kenya. Dorcas is    years old  and she was trained in self defense. A few months ago she was picked up on the street by three older men. They kidnapped her  they put her in a car. And through her self defense  she grabbed their Adam's apples  she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car. In Kenya  in August  I went to visit one of the V Day safe houses for girls  a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio. Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl  she was female genitally mutilated. And she made a decision as many women do across this planet  that what was done to her would not be enforced and done to other women and girls. So  for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley. She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like  and what a mutilated vagina looked like. And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her we asked her what we could do for her  and she said   Well  if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster.  So  we got her a Jeep. And then she saved       girls. And then we asked her   Okay  what else do you need   And she said   Well  now  I need a house.  So  seven years ago Agnes built the first V Day safe house in Narok  Kenya  in the Masai land. And it was a house where girls could run away  they could save their clitoris  they wouldn't be cut  they could go to school. And in the years that Agnes has had the house  she has changed the situation there. She has literally become deputy mayor. She's changed the rules. The whole community has bought in to what she's doing. When we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls  who have run away  with their families. And there was a young girl named Jaclyn. Jaclyn was    years old and she was in her Masai family and there's a drought in Kenya. So cows are dying  and cows are the most valued possession. And Jaclyn overheard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to sell her for the cows. And she knew that meant she would be cut. She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school. She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future. She knew she would have to marry that old man  and she was   . So  one afternoon  she'd heard about the safe house  Jaclyn left her father's house and she walked for two days  two days through Masai land. She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night. She imagined her father killing her on one hand  and Mama Agnes greeting her  with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house. And when she got to the house she was greeted. Agnes took her in  and Agnes loved her  and Agnes supported her for the year. She went to school and she found her voice  and she found her identity  and she found her heart. Then  her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation  after a year. I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled. In that hut  we walked in  and her father and his four wives were sitting there  and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled  and her primary mother  who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders. When her father saw her and saw who she had become  in her full girl self  he threw his arms around her and broke down crying. He said   You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman. We will not cut you. And I give you my word  here and now  that we will not cut your sisters either.  And what she said to him was   You were willing to sell me for four cows  and a calf and some blankets. But I promise you  now that I will be educated I will always take care of you  and I will come back and I will build you a house. And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life.  For me  that is the power of girls. And that is the power of transformation. I want to close today with a new piece from my book. And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here. And I want to do it for Sunitha. And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday  the girls who survive  the girls who can become somebody else. But I really want to do it for each and every person here  to value the girl in us  to value the part that cries  to value the part that's emotional  to value the part that's vulnerable  to understand that's where the future lies. This is called  I'm An Emotional Creature.  And it happened because I met a girl in Watts  L.A. I was asking girls if they like being a girl  and all the girls were like   No  I hate it. I can't stand it. It's all bad. My brothers get everything.  And this girl just sat up and went   I love being a girl. I'm an emotional creature   This is for her  I love being a girl. I can feel what you're feeling as you're feeling inside the feeling before. I am an emotional creature. Things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard pressed ideas. They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears. Oh  I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off  even though she appears to give you what you want. I know when a storm is coming. I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air. I can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share. I am an emotional creature. I love that I do not take things lightly. Everything is intense to me  the way I walk in the street  the way my momma wakes me up  the way it's unbearable when I lose  the way I hear bad news. I am an emotional creature. I am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that. Don't you say all negative that it's only only a teenage thing  or it's only because I'm a girl. These feelings make me better. They make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong. I am an emotional creature. There is a particular way of knowing. It's like the older women somehow forgot. I rejoice that it's still in my body. Oh  I know when the coconut's about to fall. I know we have pushed the Earth too far. I know my father isn't coming back  and that no one's prepared for the fire. I know that lipstick means more than show  and boys are super insecure  and so called terrorists are made  not born. I know that one kiss could take away all my decision making ability. And you know what  Sometimes it should. This is not extreme. It's a girl thing  what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open. Don't tell me not to cry  to calm it down  not to be so extreme  to be reasonable. I am an emotional creature. It's how the earth got made  how the wind continues to pollinate. You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave. I am an emotional creature. Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off  I am your remaining memory. I can take you back. Nothing's been diluted. Nothing's leaked out. I love  hear me  I love that I can feel the feelings inside you  even if they stop my life  even if they break my heart  even if they take me off track  they make me responsible. I am an emotional  I am an emotional  incondotional  devotional creature. And I love  hear me  I love  love  love being a girl. Can you say it with me  I love  I love  love  love being a girl  Thank you very much. Please close your eyes  and open your hands. Now imagine what you could place in your hands  an apple  maybe your wallet. Now open your eyes. What about a life  What you see here is a premature baby. He looks like he's resting peacefully  but in fact he's struggling to stay alive because he can't regulate his own body temperature. This baby is so tiny he doesn't have enough fat on his body to stay warm. Sadly     million babies like this are born every year around the world. Four million of these babies die annually. But the bigger problem is that the ones who do survive grow up with severe  long term health problems. The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life  its only job is to grow. If it's battling hypothermia  its organs can't develop normally  resulting in a range of health problems from diabetes  to heart disease  to low I.Q. Imagine  Many of these problems could be prevented if these babies were just kept warm. That is the primary function of an incubator. But traditional incubators require electricity and cost up to    thousand dollars. So  you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries. As a result  parents resort to local solutions like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies  or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here    methods that are both ineffective and unsafe. I've seen this firsthand over and over again. On one of my first trips to India  I met this young woman  Sevitha  who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby  Rani. She took her baby to the nearest village clinic  and the doctor advised her to take Rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator. But that hospital was over four hours away  and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there  so her baby died. Inspired by this story  and dozens of other similar stories like this  my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution  something that could work without electricity  that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use  given that the majority of births still take place in the home. We needed something that was portable  something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies and something ultra low cost  compared to the        dollars that an incubator in the U.S. costs. So  this is what we came up with. What you see here looks nothing like an incubator. It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby. You can open it up completely. It's waterproof. There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily. But the magic is in this pouch of wax. This is a phase change material. It's a wax like substance with a melting point of human body temperature     degrees Celsius. You can melt this simply using hot water and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature for four to six hours at a time  after which you simply reheat the pouch. So  you then place it into this little pocket back here  and it creates a warm micro environment for the baby. Looks simple  but we've reiterated this dozens of times by going into the field to talk to doctors  moms and clinicians to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities. We plan to launch this product in India in       and the target price point will be    dollars  less than  .  percent of the cost of a traditional incubator. Over the next five years we hope to save the lives of almost a million babies. But the longer term social impact is a reduction in population growth. This seems counterintuitive  but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced  population sizes also decrease  because parents don't need to anticipate that their babies are going to die. We hope that the Embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology  simple  localized  affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact. In designing this we followed a few basic principles. We really tried to understand the end user  in this case  people like Sevitha. We tried to understand the root of the problem rather than being biased by what already exists. And then we thought of the most simple solution we could to address this problem. In doing this  I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses. And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace. So  imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says   Excuse me  what is the name of this block   And you say   I'm sorry  well  this is Oak Street  that's Elm Street. This is   th  that's   th.  He says   OK  but what is the name of that block   You say   Well  blocks don't have names. Streets have names  blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets.  He leaves  a little confused and disappointed. So  now imagine you're standing on a street  anywhere in Japan  you turn to a person next to you and say   Excuse me  what is the name of this street   They say   Oh  well that's Block    and this is Block   .  And you say   OK  but what is the name of this street   And they say   Well  streets don't have names. Blocks have names. Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block                       . All of these blocks have names  and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks. And you say then   OK  then how do you know your home address   He said   Well  easy  this is District Eight. There's Block     house number one.  You say   OK  but walking around the neighborhood  I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order.  He says   Of course they do. They go in the order in which they were built. The first house ever built on a block is house number one. The second house ever built is house number two. Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious.  So  I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn't even know we had  and realize that the opposite of them may also be true. So  for example  there are doctors in China who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy. So  any month you are healthy you pay them  and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed at their job. They get rich when you're healthy  not sick. In most music  we think of the  one  as the downbeat  the beginning of the musical phrase  one  two  three  four. But in West African music  the  one  is thought of as the end of the phrase  like the period at the end of a sentence. So  you can hear it not just in the phrasing  but the way they count off their music  two  three  four  one. And this map is also accurate. There's a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India  the opposite is also true. So  let's never forget  whether at TED  or anywhere else  that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear  that the opposite may also be true. Domo arigato gozaimashita.
