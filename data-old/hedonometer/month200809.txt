So  people argue vigorously about the definition of life. They ask if it should have reproduction in it  or metabolism  or evolution. And I don't know the answer to that  so I'm not going to tell you. I will say that life involves computation. So this is a computer program. Booted up in a cell  the program would execute  and it could result in this person  or with a small change  it could result in this person  or another small change  this person  or with a larger change  this dog  or this tree  or this whale. So now  if you take this metaphor  of  genome as program seriously  you have to consider that Chris Anderson is a computer fabricated artifact  as is Jim Watson  Craig Venter  as are all of us. And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true  there are lots of similarities between genetic programs and computer programs that could help to convince you. But one  to me  that's most compelling is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes that can make large changes in biological development    the output. A small mutation can take a two wing fly and make it a four wing fly. Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be. Or if you're familiar with  The Princess Bride   it could create a six fingered man. Now  a hallmark of computer programs is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes. If your bank account's one dollar  and you flip a single bit  you could end up with a thousand dollars. So these small changes are things that I think that    they indicate to us that a complicated computation in development is underlying these amplified  large changes. So now  all of this indicates that there are molecular programs underlying biology  and it shows the power of molecular programs    biology does. And what I want to do is write molecular programs  potentially to build technology. And there are a lot of people doing this  a lot of synthetic biologists doing this  like Craig Venter. And they concentrate on using cells. They're cell oriented. So my friends  molecular programmers  and I have a sort of biomolecule centric approach. We're interested in using DNA  RNA and protein  and building new languages for building things from the bottom up  using biomolecules  potentially having nothing to do with biology. So  these are all the machines in a cell. There's a camera. There's the solar panels of the cell  some switches that turn your genes on and off  the girders of the cell  motors that move your muscles. My little group of molecular programmers are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA. We're not DNA zealots  but DNA is the cheapest  easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this. And as other things become easier to use    maybe protein    we'll work with those. If we succeed  what will molecular programming look like  You're going to sit in front of your computer. You're going to design something like a cell phone  and in a high level language  you'll describe that cell phone. Then you're going to have a compiler that's going to take that description and it's going to turn it into actual molecules that can be sent to a synthesizer and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed. And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately  is it will do a developmental computation  a molecular computation  and it'll build an electronic computer. And if I haven't revealed my prejudices already  I think that life has been about molecular computers building electrochemical computers  building electronic computers  which together with electrochemical computers will build new molecular computers  which will build new electronic computers  and so forth. And if you buy all of this  and you think life is about computation  as I do  then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist. So one big question is  how does a baby know when to stop growing  And for molecular programming  the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing  Or how does a computer program know when to stop running  Or more to the point  how do you know if a program will ever stop  There are other questions like this  too. One of them is Craig Venter's question. Turns out I think he's actually a computer scientist. He asked  how big is the minimal genome that will give me a functioning microorganism  How few genes can I use  This is exactly analogous to the question  what's the smallest program I can write that will act exactly like Microsoft Word  And just as he's writing  you know  bacteria that will be smaller  he's writing genomes that will work  we could write smaller programs that would do what Microsoft Word does. But for molecular programming  our question is  how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone  What's the smallest number we can get away with  Now  these are big questions in computer science. These are all complexity questions  and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions. Almost    many of them are impossible. But for some tasks  we can start to answer them. So  I'm going to start asking those questions for the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next. So  this is normal DNA  what you think of as normal DNA. It's double stranded  it's a double helix  has the As  Ts  Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together. And I'm going to draw it like this sometimes  just so I don't scare you. We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix. When we synthesize it  it comes single stranded  so we can take the blue strand in one tube and make an orange strand in the other tube  and they're floppy when they're single stranded. You mix them together and they make a rigid double helix. Now for the last    years  Ned Seeman and a bunch of his descendants have worked very hard and made beautiful three dimensional structures using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together. But a lot of their approaches  though elegant  take a long time. They can take a couple of years  or it can be difficult to design. So I came up with a new method a couple of years ago I call DNA origami that's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen and design the stuff on a laptop. But to do it  you need a long  single strand of DNA  which is technically very difficult to get. So  you can go to a natural source. You can look in this computer fabricated artifact  and he's got a double stranded genome    that's no good. You look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria. They're no good either. Double strand again  but inside them  they're infected with a virus that has a nice  long  single stranded genome that we can fold like a piece of paper. And here's how we do it. This is part of that genome. We add a bunch of short  synthetic DNAs that I call staples. Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place  and a right half that binds it in a different place  and brings the long strand together like this. The net action of many of these on that long strand is to fold it into something like a rectangle. Now  we can't actually take a movie of this process  but Shawn Douglas at Harvard has made a nice visualization for us that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it. And what happens is that we mix these strands together. We heat them up  we add a little bit of salt  we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down  and as we cool them down  the short strands bind the long strands and start to form structure. And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there. When you look at DNA origami  you can see that what it really is  even though you think it's complicated  is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other  and they're held together by places where short strands go along one helix and then jump to another one. So there's a strand that goes like this  goes along one helix and binds    it jumps to another helix and comes back. That holds the long strand like this. Now  to show that we could make any shape or pattern that we wanted  I tried to make this shape. I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye  down the nose  up the nose  around the forehead  back down and end in a little loop like this. And so  I thought  if this could work  anything could work. So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this. I ordered them  they came by FedEx. I mixed them up  heated them  cooled them down  and I got    billion little smiley faces floating around in a single drop of water. And each one of these is just one thousandth the width of a human hair  OK  So  they're all floating around in solution  and to look at them  you have to get them on a surface where they stick. So  you pour them out onto a surface and they start to stick to that surface  and we take a picture using an atomic force microscope. It's got a needle  like a record needle  that goes back and forth over the surface  bumps up and down  and feels the height of the first surface. It feels the DNA origami. There's the atomic force microscope working and you can see that the landing's a little rough. When you zoom in  they've got  you know  weak jaws that flip over their heads and some of their noses get punched out  but it's pretty good. You can zoom in and even see the extra little loop  this little nano goatee. Now  what's great about this is anybody can do this. And so  I got this in the mail about a year after I did this  unsolicited. Anyone know what this is  What is it  It's China  right  So  what happened is  a graduate student in China  Lulu Qian  did a great job. She wrote all her own software to design and built this DNA origami  a beautiful rendition of China  which even has Taiwan  and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash  right  So  this works really well and you can make patterns as well as shapes  OK  And you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA. And what's really neat about it    well  actually  this all looks like nano artwork  but it turns out that nano artwork is just what you need to make nano circuits. So  you can put circuit components on the staples  like a light bulb and a light switch. Let the thing assemble  and you'll get some kind of a circuit. And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over. So  this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did. They took a DNA origami  organized some carbon nano tubes  made a little switch  you see here  wired it up  tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch. Now  this is just a single switch and you need half a billion for a computer  so we have a long way to go. But this is very promising because the origami can organize parts just one tenth the size of those in a normal computer. So it's very promising for making small computers. Now  I want to get back to that compiler. The DNA origami is a proof that that compiler actually works. So  you start with something in the computer. You get a high level description of the computer program  a high level description of the origami. You can compile it to molecules  send it to a synthesizer  and it actually works. And it turns out that a company has made a nice program that's much better than my code  which was kind of ugly  and will allow us to do this in a nice  visual  computer aided design way. So  now you can say  all right  why isn't DNA origami the end of the story  You have your molecular compiler  you can do whatever you want. The fact is that it does not scale. So if you want to build a human from DNA origami  the problem is  you need a long strand that's    trillion trillion bases long. That's three light years' worth of DNA  so we're not going to do this. We're going to turn to another technology  called algorithmic self assembly of tiles. It was started by Erik Winfree  and what it does  it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami. You zoom in  there are just four DNA strands and they have little single stranded bits on them that can bind to other tiles  if they match. And we like to draw these tiles as little squares. And if you look at their sticky ends  these little DNA bits  you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern. So  these tiles would make a complicated  self assembling checkerboard. And the point of this  if you didn't catch that  is that tiles are a kind of molecular program and they can output patterns. And a really amazing part of this is that any computer program can be translated into one of these tile programs    specifically  counting. So  you can come up with a set of tiles that when they come together  form a little binary counter rather than a checkerboard. So you can read off binary numbers five  six and seven. And in order to get these kinds of computations started right  you need some kind of input  a kind of seed. You can use DNA origami for that. You can encode the number    in the right hand side of a DNA origami  and when you add those tiles that count  they will start to count    they will read that    and they'll stop at   . So  what we've done is we've figured out a way to have a molecular program know when to stop going. It knows when to stop growing because it can count. It knows how big it is. So  that answers that sort of first question I was talking about. It doesn't tell us how babies do it  however. So now  we can use this counting to try and get at much bigger things than DNA origami could otherwise. Here's the DNA origami  and what we can do is we can write    on both edges of the DNA origami  and we can now use our watering can and water with tiles  and we can start growing tiles off of that and create a square. The counter serves as a template to fill in a square in the middle of this thing. So  what we've done is we've succeeded in making something much bigger than a DNA origami by combining DNA origami with tiles. And the neat thing about it is  is that it's also reprogrammable. You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation and you'll get    rather than   . And if you do that  the origami's the same size  but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger. So  this sort of recapitulates what I was telling you about development. You have a very sensitive computer program where small changes    single  tiny  little mutations    can take something that made one size square and make something very much bigger. Now  this    using counting to compute and build these kinds of things by this kind of developmental process is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question. So  you can ask  how many DNA strands are required to build a square of a given size  If we wanted to make a square of size         or        if we used DNA origami alone  we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square of the size of that square  so we'd need             or a million DNA strands. That's really not affordable. But if we use a little computation    we use origami  plus some tiles that count    then we can get away with using          or     DNA strands. And so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use  if we use counting  if we use a little bit of computation. And so computation is some very powerful way to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something  to reduce the size of the genome that you're building. And finally  I'm going to get back to that sort of crazy idea about computers building computers. If you look at the square that you build with the origami and some counters growing off it  the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need to make a memory. So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles    rather than to the staple strands  you affix them to the tiles    then they'll self assemble the somewhat complicated circuits  the demultiplexer circuits  that you need to address this memory. So you can actually make a complicated circuit using a little bit of computation. It's a molecular computer building an electronic computer. Now  you ask me  how far have we gotten down this path  Experimentally  this is what we've done in the last year. Here is a DNA origami rectangle  and here are some tiles growing from it. And you can see how they count. One  two  three  four  five  six  nine                . So it's got some errors  but at least it counts up. So  it turns out we actually had this idea nine years ago  and that's about the time constant for how long it takes to do these kinds of things  so I think we made a lot of progress. We've got ideas about how to fix these errors. And I think in the next five or    years  we'll make the kind of squares that I described and maybe even get to some of those self assembled circuits. So now  what do I want you to take away from this talk  I want you to remember that to create life's very diverse and complex forms  life uses computation to do that. And the computations that it uses  they're molecular computations  and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it  as Feynman said  you know  we need to build something to understand it. And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing  rebuild everything from the bottom up  using DNA in ways that nature never intended  using DNA origami  and DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self assembly. You know  so this is all very cool  but what I'd like you to take from the talk  hopefully from some of those big questions  is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets. It's not just making about    it's making self assembled cell phones and circuits. What it's really about is taking computer science and looking at big questions in a new light  asking new versions of those big questions and trying to understand how biology can make such amazing things. Thank you. My mission in life since I was a kid was  and is  to take the rest of you into space. It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth  take the people of Earth and transition off  permanently. And that's exciting. In fact  I think it is a moral imperative that we open the space frontier. You know  it's the first time that we're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy  a chance to  if you would  back up the biosphere. And if you think about space  everything we hold of value on this planet    metals and minerals and real estate and energy    is in infinite quantities in space. In fact  the Earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources. The analogy for me is Alaska. You know  we bought Alaska. We Americans bought Alaska in the     s. It's called Seward's folly. We valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill. And then we discovered these things    gold and oil and fishing and timber    and it became  you know  a trillion dollar economy  and now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space. We are on the verge of the greatest exploration that the human race has ever known. We explore for three reasons  the weakest of which is curiosity. You know  it's funded NASA's budget up until now. Some images from Mars      . In fact  I think in the next decade  without any question  we will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous under the soils and different parts of that planet. The stronger motivator  the much stronger motivator  is fear. It drove us to the moon. We    literally in fear    with the Soviet Union raced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks  you know  killer sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there  and while the probability is very small  the impact  figured in literally  of one of these hitting the Earth is so huge that to spend a small fraction looking  searching  preparing to defend  is not unreasonable. And of course  the third motivator  one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur  is wealth. In fact  the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids  there's a class of the nickel iron  which in platinum group metal markets alone are worth something like    trillion dollars  if you can go out and grab one of these rocks. My plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market  and then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one. And that will fund the actual mission to go and get one. But fear  curiosity and greed have driven us. And for me  this is    I'm the short kid on the right. This was    my motivation was actually during Apollo. And Apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever. If you think about what happened at the turn of    early     s  on May     JFK said   We're going to go to the moon.  And people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations to go and be part of this amazing mission. And we knew nothing about going to space. We went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years  and the average age of the people that got us there was    years old. They didn't know what couldn't be done. They had to make up everything. And that  my friend  is amazing motivation. This is Gene Cernan  a good friend of mine  saying   If I can go to the moon     this is the last human on the moon so far     nothing  nothing is impossible.  But of course  we've thought about the government always as the person taking us there. But I put forward here  the government is not going to get us there. The government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier. The shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch. That's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable. We shouldn't be happy in standing for that. One of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE was take the challenge on that risk is OK  you know. As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier  we should be allowed to risk. In fact  anyone who says we shouldn't  you know  just needs to be put aside  because  as we go forward  in fact  the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us. The entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals  and clearly the industrial military complex    with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA    are the dinosaurs. The ability for us to access these resources to gain planetary redundancy    we can now gather all the information  the genetic codes  you know  everything stored on our databases  and back them up off the planet  in case there would be one of those disastrous situations. The difficulty is getting there  and clearly  the cost to orbit is key. Once you're in orbit  you are two thirds of the way  energetically  to anywhere    the moon  to Mars. And today  there's only three vehicles    the U.S. shuttle  the Russian Soyuz and the Chinese vehicle    that gets you there. Arguably  it's about     million dollars a person on the space shuttle. One of the companies I started  Space Adventures  will sell you a ticket. We've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz to go up to the space station for    million dollars. But that's expensive and to understand what the potential is    it is expensive. But people are willing to pay that  You know  one    we have a very unique period in time today. For the first time ever  we have enough wealth concentrated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow us to really drive space exploration. But how cheap could it get  I want to give you the end point. We know       million dollars today  you can go and buy a ticket  but how cheap could it get  Let's go back to high school physics here. If you calculate the amount of potential energy  mgh  to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles  and then you accelerate yourself to        miles per hour    remember  that one half MV squared    and you figure it out. It's about  .  gigajoules of energy. If you expended that over an hour  it's about  .  megawatts. If you go to one of Vijay's micro power sources  and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour    anybody here fast in math  How much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit      bucks. That's the price improvement curve that    we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way  I'll grant you that. But guys  if history has taught us anything  it's that if you can imagine it  you will get there eventually. I have no question that the physics  the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner. The difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment. Today  the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar of their own money in R D. It's all government research dollars  and very few of those. And in fact  the large corporations  the governments  can't take the risk. So we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space. Today's commercial markets worldwide  global commercial launch market     to    launches per year. Number of commercial companies out there     to    companies. One per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace  and I call them self loading carbon payloads. They come with their own money. They're easy to make. It's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution  reading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there. We offered    million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship  carry three people up to     kilometers  come back down  and within two weeks  make the trip again. Twenty six teams from seven countries entered the competition  spending between one to    million dollars each. And of course  we had beautiful SpaceShipOne  which made those two flights and won the competition. And I'd like to take you there  to that morning  for just a quick video. Richard Searfoss  Good luck. RS  We've got an altitude call of         feet. RS  So in my official capacity as the chief judge of the Ansari X PRIZE competition  I declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures has indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE. Peter Diamandis  Probably the most difficult thing that I had to do was raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible. We went    I went to          CEOs  CMOs. No one believed it was done. Everyone said   Oh  what does NASA think  Well  people are going to die  how can you possibly going to put this forward   I found a visionary family  the Ansari family  and Champ Car  and raised part of the money  but not the full    million. And what I ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry and buying a hole in one insurance policy. See  the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed  and said   Are you going to compete   No.  Are you going to compete   No.  No one's going to win this thing.  So  they took a bet that no one would win by January of '    and I took a bet that someone would win. So    and the best thing is they paid off and the check didn't bounce. We've had a lot of accomplishments and it's been a tremendous success. One of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne is going to hang in Air and Space Museum  next to the Spirit of St. Louis and the Wright Flyer. Isn't that great   Applause  So a little bit about the future  steps to space  what's available for you. Today  you can go and experience weightless flights. By '    suborbital flights  the price tag for that  you know  on Virgin  is going to be about        . There are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly  I think  to about        dollars for a suborbital flight. Orbital flights    we can take you to the space station. And then I truly believe  once a group is in orbit around the Earth    I know if they don't do it  I am    we're going to stockpile some fuel  make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate. Quick moment for the designers in the audience. We spent    years getting FAA approval to do zero gravity flights. Here are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutan and my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity    people think a zero gravity room  there's a switch on there that turns it off    but it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane. And turns out   Up has just done a little commercial that's airing this month. If we can get the audio up  look for specially marked packages of Diet   Up. When you want the taste that won't weigh you down  the only way to go is up. PD  That was filmed inside our airplane  and so  you can now do this. We're based down in Florida. Let me talk about the other thing I'm excited about. The future of prizes. You know  prizes are a very old idea. I had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize and the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward. And we have made a decision in the X PRIZE Foundation to actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas  and we just took on a new mission statement   to bring about radical breakthroughs in space and other technologies for the benefit of humanity.  And this is something that we're very excited about. I showed this slide to Larry Page  who just joined our board. And you know  when you give to a nonprofit  you might have    cents on the dollar. If you have a matching grant  it's typically two or three to one. If you put up a prize  you can get literally a    to one leverage on your dollars. And that's huge. And then he turned around and said   Well  if you back a prize institute that runs a    prize  you get     to one.  I said   Well  that's great.  So  we have actually    are looking to turn the X PRIZE into a world class prize institute. This is what happens when you put up a prize  when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials. You get publicity increase  and when it's won  publicity shoots through the roof    if it's properly managed    and that's part of the benefits to a sponsor. Then  when the prize is actually won  after it's moving  you get societal benefits  you know  new technology  new capability. And the benefit to the sponsors is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term. That's our value proposition in a prize. If you were going to go and try to create SpaceShipOne  or any kind of a new technology  you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome. It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize  the beautiful thing is  you know  it's a very small maintenance fee  and you pay on success. Orteig didn't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across    tried to go across the Atlantic  and we didn't pay a dime until someone won the Ansari X PRIZE. So  prizes work great. You know  innovators  the entrepreneurs out there  you know that when you're going for a goal  the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself. Then  you've got to  you know  face potential public ridicule of    that's a crazy idea  it'll never work. And then you have to convince others  so that they can  in fact  help you raise the funds  and then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucracies and institutions that don't want you to move those things forward  and you have to deal with failures. What a prize does  what we've experienced a prize doing  is literally help to short circuit or support all of these things  because a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea. Well  it must be a good idea. Someone's offering    million dollars to go and do this thing. And each of these areas was something that we found the Ansari X PRIZE helped short circuit these for innovation. So  as an organization  we put together a prize discovery process of how to come up with prizes and write the rules  and we're actually looking at creating prizes in a number of different categories. We're looking at attacking energy  environment  nanotechnology    and I'll talk about those more in a moment. And the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams within the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team. We're going after an orbital prize. We are looking at a number of energy prizes. Craig Venter has just joined our board and we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him  we'll be announcing later this fall  about    imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA for under       dollars  revolutionize medicine. And clean water  education  medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship. So my final slide here is  the most critical tool for solving humanity's grand challenges    it isn't technology  it isn't money  it's only one thing    it's the committed  passionate human mind. Well  good morning. You know  the computer and television both recently turned     and today I'd like to talk about their relationship. Despite their middle age  if you've been following the themes of this conference or the entertainment industry  it's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other. So it's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television  or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces that lead to the writers' strike. And it's not just what these are doing to each other  but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter. To get a sense of this  and it's been a theme we've talked about all week  I recently talked to a bunch of tweeners. I wrote on cards   television    radio    MySpace    Internet    PC.  And I said  just arrange these  from what's important to you and what's not  and then tell me why. Let's listen to what happens when they get to the portion of the discussion on television. because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs. Peter Hirshberg  Which is more fun  Internet or TV  Girls  Internet. Girl    I think we    the reasons  one of the reasons we put computer before TV is because nowadays  like  we have TV shows on the computer. Girl    And then you can download onto your iPod. PH  Would you like to be the president of a TV network  Girl    I wouldn't like it. Girl    That would be so stressful. Girl    No. PH  How come  Girl    Because they're going to lose all their money eventually. Girl    Like the stock market  it goes up and down and stuff. I think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff. PH  There's been an uneasy relationship between the TV business and the tech business  really ever since they both turned about   . We go through periods of enthrallment  followed by reactions in boardrooms  in the finance community best characterized as  what's the finance term  Ick pooey. Let me give you an example of this. The year is       and Warner buys Atari because video games are on the rise. The next year they march forward and they introduce Qube  the first interactive cable TV system  and the New York Times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home  convergence  great things are happening. Everybody in the East Coast gets in the pictures    Citicorp  Penney  RCA    all getting into this big vision. By the way  this is about when I enter the picture. I'm going to do a summer internship at Time Warner. That summer I'm all    I'm at Warner that summer    I'm all excited to work on convergence  and then the bottom falls out. Doesn't work out too well for them  they lose money. And I had a happy brush with convergence until  kind of  Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing. That's when I leave graduate school  and I can't work in New York on kind of entertainment and technology because I have to be exiled to California  where the remaining jobs are  almost to the sea  to go to work for Apple Computer. Warner  of course  writes off more than     million dollars. Four hundred million dollars  which was real money back in the '  s. But they were onto something and they got better at it. By the year       the process was perfected. They merged with AOL  and in just four years  managed to shed about     billion dollars of market capitalization  showing that they'd actually mastered the art of applying Moore's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet. Now  I think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities  or the media community  is driven so crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently. You know  for    years  we've talked about changing the world  about total transformation. For    years  it's been about hopes and fears and promises of a better world. And I got to thinking  you know  who else talks that way  And the answer is pretty clearly    it's people in religion and in politics. And so I realized that actually the tech world is best understood  not as a business cycle  but as a messianic movement. We promise something great  we evangelize it  we're going to change the world. It doesn't work out too well  and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again  as the people in New York and L.A. look on in absolute  morbid astonishment. But it's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing. So  what I'd like to ask is  if the computer is becoming a principal tool of media and entertainment  how did we get here  I mean  how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media  Of course  the first computer was built just after World War II to solve military problems  but things got really interesting just a couple of years later         with Whirlwind  built at MIT's Lincoln Lab. Jay Forrester was building this for the Navy  but you can't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind a machine that might actually be a potential media star. So take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers  and the computer begins to express itself. With considerable trepidation  we undertake to interview this new machine. Jay Forrester  Hello New York  this is Cambridge. And this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer. Would you like if I used the machine  Journalist  Yes  of course. But I have an idea  Mr. Forrester. Since this computer was made in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research  why don't we switch down to the Pentagon in Washington and let the Navy's research chief  Admiral Bolster  give Whirlwind the workout  Calvin Bolster  Well  Ed  this problem concerns the Navy's Viking rocket. This rocket goes up     miles into the sky. Now  at the standard rate of fuel consumption  I would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket and see how it can determine  at any instant  say at the end of    seconds  the amount of fuel remaining  and the velocity at that set instant. JF  Over on the left hand side  you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off. And on the right hand side  there's a scale that shows the rocket's velocity. The rocket's position is shown by the trajectory that we're now looking at. And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory  the velocity  you will notice  has dropped off to a minimum. Then  as the rocket dives down  velocity picks up again toward a maximum velocity and the rocket hits the ground. How's that  Journalist  What about that  Admiral  CB  Looks very good to me. JF  And before leaving  we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out in their spare time  in a less serious vein  for a Sunday afternoon.  Music  Journalist  Thank you very much indeed  Mr. Forrester and the MIT lab. PH  You know  so much was worked out  the first real time interaction  the video display  pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer  but unfortunately  it was too pricey for the Navy  and all of this would have been lost if it weren't for a happy coincidence. Enter the atomic bomb. We're threatened by the greatest weapon ever  and knowing a good thing when it sees it  the Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us. They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system  deploy it all across the frozen north  and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the Manhattan Project building the A Bomb in the first place. Talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry. And you can imagine that the Air Force became a pretty good salesman. Here's their marketing video. before we could determine their tracks. And then it would be too late to act. We cannot afford to take that chance. It is to meet this threat that the Air Force has been developing SAGE  the Semi Automatic Ground Environment system  to strengthen our air defenses. This new computer  built to become the nerve center of a defense network  is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid. It is provided with its own powerhouse containing large diesel driven generators  air conditioning equipment  and cooling towers required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer. PH  You know  that one computer was huge. There's an interesting marketing lesson from it  which is basically  when you market a product  you can either say  this is going to be wonderful  it will make you feel better and enliven you. Or there's one other marketing proposition  if you don't use our product  you'll die. This is a really good example of that. This had the first pointing device. It was distributed  so it worked out    distributed computing and modems    so all these things could talk to each other. About    percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing  and it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes. You saw how huge it was  and to give you a sense for this    because we've talked a lot about Moore's law and making things small at this conference  so let's talk about making things large. If we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know  say  Century City  it would fit beautifully. You'd kind of have to take Century City out  but it could fit in there. But like  let's imagine we took the latest Pentium processor  the latest Core   Extreme  which is a four core processor that Intel's working on  it will be our laptop tomorrow. To build that  what we'd do with Whirlwind technology is we'd have to take up roughly from the    to Mulholland  and from the     to La Cienega just with those Whirlwinds. And then  the    nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of Los Angeles. That's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of France creates. So  the next time they tell you they're on to something  clearly they're not. So    and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs. But it gives you the kind of power that people have  that the audience has  and the reasons these transformations are happening. All of this stuff starts moving into industry. DEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini computer. It shows up at places like MIT  and then a mutation happens. Spacewar  is built  the first computer game  and all of a sudden  interactivity and involvement and passion is worked out. Actually  many MIT students stayed up all night long working on this thing  and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out. DEC knew a good thing about wasting time. It shipped every one of its computers with that game. Meanwhile  as all of this is happening  by the mid '  s  the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely. A new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls and they're quite certain that television is about to do them in. In fact  despair is in the air. And a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything I've been reading all week. RCA had David Sarnoff  who basically commercialized radio  said this   I don't say that radio networks must die. Every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern  new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues. It may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio  but I don't know how.  And of course  as the computer industry develops interactively  producers in the emerging TV business actually hit on the same idea. And they fake it. up on the set  you just get them out. First of all  get your Winky Dink kits out. Put out your Magic Window and your erasing glove  and rub it like this. That's the way we get some of the magic into it  boys and girls. Then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set  and rub it out from the center to the corners  like this. Make sure you keep your magic crayons handy  your Winky Dink crayons and your erasing glove  because you'll be using them during the show to draw like that. You all set  OK  let's get right to the first story about Dusty Man. Come on into the secret lab. PH  It was the dawn of interactive TV  and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the Winky Dink kits. Those are the Winky Dink crayons. I know what you're saying.  Pete  I could use any ordinary open source crayon  why do I have to buy theirs   I assure you  that's not the case. Turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your Winky Dink Magic Window  other crayons may discolor or hurt the window. This proprietary principle of vendor lock in would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere. It led to lawsuits    federal investigations  and lots of repercussions  and that's a scandal we won't discuss today. But we will discuss this scandal  because this man  Jack Berry  the host of  Winky Dink   went on to become the host of  Twenty One   one of the most important quiz shows ever. And it was rigged  and it became unraveled when this man  Charles van Doren  was outed after an unnatural winning streak  ending Berry's career. And actually  ending the career of a lot of people at CBS. It turns out there was a lot to learn about how this new medium worked. And    years ago  if you'd been at a meeting like this and were trying to understand the media  there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from  Professor Marshall McLuhan. He actually understood something about a theme that we've been discussing all week. It's the role of the audience in an era of pervasive electronic communications. Here he is talking from the     s. of making the ad  then it's happy. It's like the old quiz shows. They were great TV because it gave the audience a role  something to do. They were horrified when they discovered they'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged. Now  then  this was a horrible misunderstanding of TV on the part of the programmers. PH  You know  McLuhan talked about the global village. If you substitute the word blogosphere  of the Internet today  it is very true that his understanding is probably very enlightening now. Let's listen in to him. in which you don't necessarily have harmony. You have extreme concern with everybody else's business and much involvement in everybody else's life. It's a sort of Ann Landers' column writ large. And it doesn't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet  but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else's affairs. And so the global village is as big as a planet  and as small as a village post office. PH  We'll talk a little bit more about him later. We're now right into the     s. It's the era of big business and data centers for computing. But all that was about to change. You know  the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in. And when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations  it's not just a joke about messianism  it's actually what we do. But for this part of the story  I'd actually like to throw it to America's leading technology correspondent  John Markoff. in drugs  sex  rock 'n' roll and the anti war movement had to do with computing  Everything. It all happened within five miles of where I'm standing  at Stanford University  between      and     . In the midst of revolution in the streets and rock and roll concerts in the parks  a group of researchers led by people like John McCarthy  a computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab  and Doug Engelbart  a computer scientist at SRI  changed the world. Engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture  but while he was beginning to do his work  all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid peninsula. There was LSD leaking out of Kesey's Veterans' Hospital experiments and other areas around the campus  and there was music literally in the streets. The Grateful Dead was playing in the pizza parlors. People were leaving to go back to the land. There was the Vietnam War. There was black liberation. There was women's liberation. This was a remarkable place  at a remarkable time. And into that ferment came the microprocessor. I think it was that interaction that led to personal computing. They saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build. And most importantly  they had this ethos of sharing information. I think these ideas are difficult to understand  because when you're trapped in one paradigm  the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe    it makes no sense. The stories were so compelling that I decided to write a book about them. The title of the book is   What the Dormouse Said  How the '  s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry.  The title was taken from the lyrics to a Jefferson Airplane song. The lyrics go   Remember what the dormouse said. Feed your head  feed your head  feed your head.   Music  PH  By this time  computing had kind of leapt into media territory  and in short order much of what we're doing today was imagined in Cambridge and Silicon Valley. Here's the Architecture Machine Group  the predecessor of the Media Lab  in     . Meanwhile  in California  we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff. HyperCard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks  where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture  or piece of text  or data across a file system  and we had no way of explaining it. There was no metaphor. Was it a database  A prototyping tool  A scripted language  Heck  it was everything. So we ended up writing a marketing brochure. We asked a question about how the mind works  and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant. A few years later  we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of  how do you get the content you want  the way you want it and the easy way  Here's the Apple marketing video. to create a HyperCard interactive video. The most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own HyperCard stacks. By far the simplest method is to buy a pre made videodisc and HyperCard stacks from a commercial supplier. The method we illustrate in this video uses a pre made videodisc but creates custom HyperCard stacks. This method allows you to use existing videodisc materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests. PH  I hope you realize how subversive that is. That's like a Dick Cheney speech. You think he's a nice balding guy  but he's just declared war on the content business. Find the commercial stuff  mash it up  tell the story your way. Now  as long as we confine this to the education market  and a personal matter between the computer and the file system  that's fine  but as you can see  it was about to leap out and upset Jack Valenti and a lot of other people. By the way  speaking of the filing system  it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network. A few years later  Tim Berners Lee worked that out. It became a killer app of links  and today  of course  we call that the World Wide Web. Now  not only was I instrumental in helping Apple miss the Internet  but a couple of years later  I helped Bill Gates do the same thing. The year is      and he was working on a book and I was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this. We were plenty aware that we were messing with media  and on the surface  it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things  but we also missed an awful lot. Let's take a look. and TV dinners  ancient and modern wonders of the man made world all. Yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty first century technology  the Digital Superhighway. Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long forgotten politicians. The Digital Highway arrived in America's living rooms late in the twentieth century. Let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible. The Digital Highway would follow the rutted trail first blazed by Alexander Graham Bell. Though some were incredulous ... Man    The phone company  Narrator  Stirred by the prospects of mass communication and making big bucks on advertising  David Sarnoff commercializes radio. Man    Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand. Narrator  The medium introduced America to new products. Voice    Say  mom  Windows for Radio means more enjoyment and greater ease of use for the whole family. Be sure to enjoy Windows for Radio at home and at work. Narrator  In       the Radio Corporation of America introduced television. Man    Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand. Narrator  Eventually  the race to the future took on added momentum with the breakup of the telephone company. And further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry  and the re regulation of the cable television industry. Ted Turner  We did the work to build this  this cable industry  now the broadcasters want some of our money. I mean  it's ridiculous. Narrator  Computers  once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks  escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas. The world and all its culture reduced to bits  the lingua franca of all media. And the forces of convergence exploded. Finally  four great industrial sectors combined. Telecommunications  entertainment  computing and everything else. Man    We'll see channels for the gourmet and we'll see channels for the pet lover. Voice    Next on the gourmet pet channel  decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer. Narrator  All of industry was in play  as investors flocked to place their bets. At stake  the battle for you  the consumer  and the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of America.  Music  PH  We missed a lot. You know  you missed  we missed the Internet  the long tail  the role of the audience  open systems  social networks. It just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media. Thomas Edison had the same problem. He wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it  and kind of only one of his ideas turned out to have been the right early idea. Well  you know where we're going on from here. We come into the era of the dotcom  the World Wide Web  and I don't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together. But when we emerge from this and what we call Web  .   things actually are quite different. And I think it's the reason that TV's so challenged. If Internet one was about pages  now it's about people. It's a customer  it's an audience  it's a person who's participating. It's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now. PH  In my own company  Technorati  we see something like        blog posts an hour come in. That's about       fresh  connective links across about     million blogs that are out there. And it's no wonder that as we head into the writers' strike  odd things happen. You know  it reminds me of that old saw in Hollywood  that a producer is anyone who knows a writer. I now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem. But it's not a joke. This is a real headline.  Websites attract striking writers  operators of sites like MyDamnChannel.com could benefit from labor disputes.  Meanwhile  you have the TV bloggers going out on strike  in sympathy with the television writers. And then you have TV Guide  a Fox property  which is about to sponsor the online video awards    but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television  not appearing to gloat. To show you how schizophrenic this all is  here's the head of MySpace  or Fox Interactive  a News Corp company  being asked  well  with the writers' strike  isn't this going to hurt News Corp and help you online  there's an opportunity for more people to experience video on places like MySpace TV. PH  Oh  but then he remembers he works for Rupert Murdoch. as part of Fox Entertainment Group. Obviously  we hope that the strike is    that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible. PH  One of the great things that's going on here is the globalization of content really is happening. Here is a clip from a video  from a piece of animation that was written by a writer in Hollywood  animation worked out in Israel  farmed out to Croatia and India  and it's now an international series. in the months preceding the presidential primaries. Voice    You'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over. Voice    You mean we'll have to live here  together  Voices      and    With her  Voice    Well  there goes the neighborhood. PH  The company that created this  Aniboom  is an interesting example of where this is headed. Traditional TV animation costs  say  between        and        dollars a minute. They're producing things for between       and     dollars a minute. And they're offering their creators    percent of the back end  in a much more entrepreneurial manner. So  it's a different model. What the entertainment business is struggling with  the world of brands is figuring out. For example  Nike now understands that Nike Plus is not just a device in its shoe  it's a network to hook its customers together. And the head of marketing at Nike says   People are coming to our site an average of three times a week. We don't have to go to them.  Which means television advertising is down    percent for Nike. Or  as Nike's head of marketing says   We're not in the business of keeping media companies alive. We're in the business of connecting with consumers.  And media companies realize the audience is important also. Here's a man announcing the new Market Watch from Dow Jones  powered     percent by the user experience on the home page    user generated content married up with traditional content. It turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them. Or  as Geoffrey Moore once told me  it's intellectual curiosity that's the trade that brands need in the age of the blogosphere. And I think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business. One of my heroes is songwriter  Ally Willis  who just wrote  The Color Purple  and has been an R and    rhythm and blues writer  and this is what she said about where songwriting's going. Ally Willis  Where millions of collaborators wanted the song  because to look at them strictly as spam is missing what this medium is about. PH  So  to wrap up  I'd love to throw it back to Marshall McLuhan  who     years ago  was dealing with audiences that were going through just as much change  and I think that  today  traditional Hollywood and the writers are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before. But I don't need to tell you this  let's throw it back to him. MM  The medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this. They don't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up. They think of the old medium  because the old medium is always the content of the new medium  as movies tend to be the content of TV  and as books used to be the content  novels used to be the content of movies. And so every time a new medium arrives  the old medium is the content  and it is highly observable  highly noticeable  but the real  real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium  and it is ignored. PH  I think it's a great time of enthrallment. There's been more raw DNA of communications and media thrown out there. Content is moving from shows to particles that are batted back and forth  and part of social communications  and I think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity. And whereas television may have gotten beat up  what's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication  and we kind of have the merger of the two industries and a new way of thinking to look at it. Thanks very much. I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps we don't understand as much as we think we do. I'd like to begin with four questions. This is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year. That's an in joke  by the way. But these four questions  actually  are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard. And they're questions that I've asked of science television producers  of audiences of science educators    so that's science teachers    and also of seven year olds  and I find that the seven year olds do marginally better than the other audiences  which is somewhat surprising. So the first question  and you might want to write this down  either on a bit of paper  physically  or a virtual piece of paper in your head. And  for viewers at home  you can try this as well. A little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot  right  I think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair  right  Where does all this stuff come from  And your next question is  can you light a little torch bulb with a battery  a bulb and one piece of wire  And would you be able to  kind of  draw a    you don't have to draw the diagram  but would you be able to draw the diagram  if you had to do it  Or would you just say  that's actually not possible  The third question is  why is it hotter in summer than in winter  I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter  but why  And finally  would you be able to    and you can sort of scribble it  if you like    scribble a plan diagram of the solar system  showing the shape of the planets' orbits  Would you be able to do that  And if you can  just scribble a pattern. OK. Now  children get their ideas not from teachers  as teachers often think  but actually from common sense  from experience of the world around them  from all the things that go on between them and their peers  and their carers  and their parents  and all of that. Experience. And one of the great experts in this field  of course  was  bless him  Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads because it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards  right  I'm not quite sure how he died  actually. Was he beheaded in the end  or hung  Now  those questions  which  of course  you've got right  and you haven't been conferring  and so on. And I    you know  normally  I would pick people out and humiliate  but maybe not in this instance. A little seed weighs a lot and  basically  all this stuff     percent of this stuff  came out of the air. Now  I guarantee that about    percent of you  or maybe it's fewer at TED  will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people  probably two of you  will come up and argue with me afterwards  and say that actually  it comes out of the ground. Now  if that was true  we'd have trucks going round the country  filling people's gardens in with soil  it'd be a fantastic business. But  actually  we don't do that. The mass of this comes out of the air. Now  I passed all my biology exams in Britain. I passed them really well  but I still came out of school thinking that that stuff came out of the ground. Second one  can you light a little torch bulb with a battery bulb and one piece of wire  Yes  you can  and I'll show you in a second how to do that. Now  I have some rather bad news  which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you  which unfortunately    the sound doesn't work in this room  so I'm going to describe to you  in true  Monty Python  fashion  what happens in the video. And in the video  a group of researchers go to MIT on graduation day. We chose MIT because  obviously  that's a very long way away from here  and you wouldn't mind too much  but it sort of works the same way in Britain and in the West Coast of the USA. And we asked them these questions  and we asked those questions of science graduates  and they couldn't answer them. And so  there's a whole lot of people saying   I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air. That's very surprising to me.  And those are science graduates. And we intercut it with   We are the premier science university in the world   because of British like hubris. And when we gave graduate engineers that question  they said it couldn't be done. And when we gave them a battery  and a piece of wire  and a bulb  and said   Can you do it   They couldn't do it. Right  And that's no different from Imperial College in London  by the way  it's not some sort of anti American thing going on. As if. Now  the reason this matters is we pay lots and lots of money for teaching people    we might as well get it right. And there are also some societal reasons why we might want people to understand what it is that's happening in photosynthesis. For example  one half of the carbon equation is how much we emit  and the other half of the carbon equation  as I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew  is how much things soak up  and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. That's what plants actually do for a living. And  for any Finnish people in the audience  this is a Finnish pun  we are  both literally and metaphorically  skating on thin ice if we don't understand that kind of thing. Now  here's how you do the battery and the bulb. It's so easy  isn't it  Of course  you all knew that. But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb  if you've only seen a circuit diagram  you might not be able to do that  and that's one of the problems. So  why is it hotter in summer than in winter  We learn  as children  that you get closer to something that's hot  and it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning  and it happens pretty early on. By extension  we think to ourselves   Why it's hotter in summer than in winter must be because we're closer to the Sun.  I promise you that most of you will have got that. Oh  you're all shaking your heads  but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly. Other ones are kind of going like this. All right. It's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun are spread out more  right  because of the tilt of the Earth. And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer  no  it isn't. The Sun is    million miles away  and we're tilting like this  right  It makes no odds. In fact  in the Northern Hemisphere  we're further from the Sun in summer  as it happens  but it makes no odds  the difference. OK  now  the scribble of the diagram of the solar system. If you believe  as most of you probably do  that it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun  you must have drawn an ellipse. Right  That would explain it  right  Except  in your    you're nodding    now  in your ellipse  have you thought   Well  what happens during the night   Between Australia and here  right  they've got summer and we've got winter  and what    does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night  and then rush back again  I mean  it's a very strange thing going on  and we hold these two models in our head  of what's right and what isn't right  and we do that  as human beings  in all sorts of fields. So  here's Copernicus' view of what the solar system looked like as a plan. That's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right  And this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar. I hope you notice the coincidence here. What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception  right  in their heads  of elliptical orbits caused by our experiences as children  What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system  to show that it's not really like that  You'd show them something like this  wouldn't you  It's a plan  looking down from above. But  no  look what I found in the textbooks. That's what you show people  right  These are from textbooks  from websites  educational websites    and almost anything you pick up is like that. And the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring to have a load of concentric circles  whereas that's much more exciting  to look at something at that angle  isn't it  Right  And by doing it at that angle  if you've got that misconception in your head  then that two dimensional representation of a three dimensional thing will be ellipses. So you've    it's crap  isn't it really  As we say. So  these mental models    we look for evidence that reinforces our models. We do this  of course  with matters of race  and politics  and everything else  and we do it in science as well. So we look  just look    and scientists do it  constantly    we look for evidence that reinforces our models  and some folks are just all too able and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models. So  being I'm in the United States  I'll have a dig at the Europeans. These are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science teaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France and the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London. And  if you look at the  kind of the way these things are constructed  there's a lot of mediation by glass  and it's very blue  and kind of professional    in that way that  you know  Woody Allen comes up from under the sheets in that scene in  Annie Hall   and said   God  that's so professional.  And that you don't    there's no passion in it  and it's not hands on  right  and  you know  pun intended. Whereas good interpretation    I'll use an example from nearby    is San Francisco Exploratorium  where all the things that    the demonstrations  and so on  are made out of everyday objects that children can understand  it's very hands on  and they can engage with  and experiment with. And I know that if the graduates at MIT and in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire and the bit of stuff  and you know  been able to do it  they would have learned how it actually works  rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it. So good interpretation is more about things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world  right  And things that    where there isn't an extra barrier of a piece of glass or machined titanium  and it all looks fantastic  OK  And the Exploratorium does that really  really well. And it's amateur  but amateur in the best sense  in other words  the root of the word being of love and passion. So  children are not empty vessels  OK  So  as  Monty Python  would have it  this is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so  but this is    children are not empty vessels. They come with their own ideas and their own theories  and unless you work with those  then you won't be able to shift them  right  And I probably haven't shifted your ideas of how the world and universe operates  either. But this applies  equally  to matters of trying to sell new technology. For example  we are  in Britain  we're trying to do a digital switchover of the whole population into digital technology  for television . And it's one of the difficult things is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works  it's quite difficult to shift those. So we're not empty vessels  the mental models that we have as children persist into adulthood. Poor teaching actually does more harm than good. In this country and in Britain  magnetism is understood better by children before they've been to school than afterwards  OK  Same for gravity  two concepts  so it's    which is quite humbling  as a  you know  if you're a teacher  and you look before and after  that's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards  after the teaching. And we collude. We design tests  or at least in Britain  so that people pass them. Right  And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back. OK  We collude  and actually if you    if someone had designed a test for me when I was doing my biology exams  to really understand  to see whether I'd understood more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together and seeing it go blue  and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air  then I might have done better at science. So the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models. Your homework is    you know  how does an aircraft's wing create lift  An obvious question  and you'll have an answer now in your heads. And the second question to that then is  ensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down. Ah ha  right. Second question is  why is the sea blue  All right  And you've all got an idea in your head of the answer. So  why is it blue on cloudy days  Ah  see. I've always wanted to say that in this country. Finally  my plea to you is to allow yourselves  and your children  and anyone you know  to kind of fiddle with stuff  because it's by fiddling with things that you  you know  you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement  it's just part of learning that's important. Thank you very much. Now    oh  oh yeah  go on then  go on. Good afternoon  good evening  whatever. We can go  jambo  guten Abend  bonsoir  but we can also ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh  ooh. That is the call that chimpanzees make before they go to sleep in the evening. You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other  from one group of nests to the next. And I want to pick up with my talk this evening from where Zeray left off yesterday. He was talking about this amazing  three year old Australopithecine child  Selam. And we've also been hearing about the history  the family tree  of mankind through DNA genetic profiling. And it was a paleontologist  the late Louis Leakey  who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees. And it was pretty extraordinary  way back then. It's kind of commonplace now  but his argument was    because he'd been searching for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa. And you can tell an awful lot about what those beings looked like from the fossils  from the shape of the muscle attachments  something about the way they lived from the various artifacts found with them. But what about how they behaved  That's what he wanted to know. And of course  behavior doesn't fossilize. He argued    and it's now a fairly common theory    that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same in our closest living relatives  the great apes  and humans today  then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape like  human like ancestor some seven million years ago. And therefore  perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us from that ancient  ancient past. Well  if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution  you very often find people speculating about how early humans may have behaved  based on the behavior of chimpanzees. They are more like us than any other living creature  and we've heard about that during this TED Conference. So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees are so like us  in certain aspects of their behavior. Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality. Of course  I gave them names. They can live to be    years or more  although we think most of them probably don't make it to    in the wild. Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's    or   . Thereafter  she has one baby only every five or six years  a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing  sleeping with the mother at night  and riding on her back. And we believe that this long period of childhood is important for chimpanzees  just as it is for us  in relation to learning. As the brain becomes ever more complex during evolution in different forms of animals  so we find that learning plays an ever more important role in an individual's life history. And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do. We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see. And we believe that it's in this way that the different tool using behaviors    that have now been seen in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa    how these are passed from one generation to the next  through observation  imitation and practice  so that we can describe these tool using behaviors as primitive culture. Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that. They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures  many of which are similar  or even identical  to ours and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing. They also kiss  hold hands  pat one another on the back. And they swagger and they throw rocks. In chimpanzee society  we find many  many examples of compassion  precursors to love and true altruism. Unfortunately  they  like us  have a dark side to their nature. They're capable of extreme brutality  even a kind of primitive war. And these really aggressive behaviors  for the most part  are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group. They are very territorially aggressive. Chimpanzees  I believe  more than any other living creature  have helped us to understand that  after all  there is no sharp line between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom. It's a very blurry line  and it's getting more blurry all the time as we make even more observations. The study that I began in      is still continuing to this day. And these chimpanzees  living their complex social lives in the wild  have helped    more than anything else    to make us realize we are part of  and not separated from  the amazing animals with whom we share the planet. So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees  like so many other creatures around the world  are losing their habitats. This is just one photograph from the air  and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe. And it was when I flew over the whole area  about    years ago  and realized that outside the park  this forest  which in      had stretched almost unbroken along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika  which is where the tiny     square mile Gombe National Park lies  that a question came to my mind.  How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees  when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive   More people are living there than the land could possibly support. The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi and over the lake from Congo. And very poor people    they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere. This led to a program  which we call TACARE. It's a very holistic way of improving the lives of the people living in the villages around the park. It started small with    villages. It's now in   . There isn't time to go into it  but it's including things like tree nurseries  methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded  almost desert like land up in these mountains. Ways of controlling  preventing soil erosion. Ways of reclaiming overused farmland  so that within two years they can again be productive. Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells. Perhaps build some schoolrooms. Most important of all  I believe  is working with small groups of women  providing them with opportunities for micro credit loans. And we've got  as is the case around the world  about    percent of all loans returned. Empowering women  working with education  providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school  in the clear understanding that  all around the world  as women's education improves  family size drops. We provide information about family planning and about HIV AIDS. And as a result of this program  something's happening for conservation. What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these    villages  instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys    and by the way  many of the staff are now Tanzanian    but when we began the TACARE program  it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages. It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers  asking what they were interested in. Were they interested in conservation  Absolutely not. They were interested in health  they were interested in education. And as time went on  and as their situation began to improve  they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation. They began to understand that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees  so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides. Today  we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem. This is an area way outside the National Park  stretching out into all these very degraded lands. And as these villages have a better standard of life  they are actually agreeing to put between    percent and    percent of their land in the highlands aside  so that once again  as the trees grow back  the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors through which they can travel to interact    as they must for genetic viability    with other remnant groups outside the National Park. So TACARE is a success. We're replicating it in other parts of Africa  around other wilderness areas which are faced with extreme population pressure. The problems in Africa  however  as we've been discussing for the whole of these first couple of days of TED  are major problems. There is a great deal of poverty. And when you get large numbers of people living in land that is not that fertile  particularly when you cut down trees  and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion  as desperate populations cut down more and more trees  so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families  what's going to happen  Something's got to give. And the other problems    in not only Africa  but the rest of the developing world and  indeed  everywhere    what are we doing to our planet  You know  the famous scientist  E. O. Wilson said that if every person on this planet attains the standard of living of the average European or American  we need three new planets. Today  they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one. And what's happened  I mean  the question here is  here we are  arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth  with this extraordinary brain  capable of the kind of technology that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences  and yet we're destroying the only home we have. The indigenous people around the world  before they made a major decision  used to sit around and ask themselves   How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead   Today  major decisions    and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here  but the developed world    major decisions involving millions of dollars  and millions of people  are often based on   How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting   And these decisions affect Africa. As I began traveling around Africa talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests  I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation. So I began traveling outside Africa  talking in Europe  talking in the United States  going to Asia. And everywhere there were these terrible problems. And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution. The air that we breathe that often poisons us. The earth is poisoning our foods. The water    water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues that we're going to face in this century    and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural  industrial and household chemicals that still are being sprayed around the world  seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience. The mangroves are being cut down  the effects of things like the tsunami get worse. We've talked about the soil erosion. We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels along with other greenhouse gasses  so called  leading to climate change. Finally  all around the world  people have begun to believe that there is something going on very wrong with our climate. All around the world climates are mixed up. And it's the poor people who are affected worse. It's Africa that already is affected. In many parts of sub Saharan Africa  the droughts are so much worse. And when the rain does come  it so often leads to flooding and added distress  and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease. And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support  who are too poor to buy food  who can't move away because the whole land is degraded. And so you get desertification    creeping  creeping  creeping    as the last of the trees are cut down. And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world. So it wasn't surprising to me that as I was traveling around the world I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope. We seem to have lost wisdom  the wisdom of the indigenous people. I asked a question.  Why   Well  do you think there could be some kind of disconnect between this extraordinarily clever brain  the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify  and the human heart  Talking about it in the non scientific term  in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect  And these young people  when I talk to them  basically they were either depressed or apathetic  or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing   We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future and there's nothing we can do about it.  We have compromised their future. I've got three little grandchildren  and every time I look at them and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age  I feel this desperation. And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots  which began right here in Tanzania and has now spread to    countries around the world. It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation. Shoots seem tiny  to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall. See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet  environmental and social. It's a message of hope. Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world can break through and can make this a better world for all living things. The most important message of Roots and Shoots  every single one of us makes a difference  every single day. We have a choice. Every one of us in this room  we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make. The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things so that the poor have choice as well. The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects. It depends on how old they are  and which country  whether they're in a city or rural  as to what kinds of projects. But basically  we have programs now from preschool right through university  with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups. And every group chooses  between them  three different kinds of project to make this a better world  recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected and impinge on each other. So one of their projects will be to help their own human community. And then  if they're able  they may raise money to help communities in other parts of the world. One of their projects will be to help animals    not just wildlife  domestic animals as well. And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share. And woven throughout all of this is a message of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves  in our families  in our communities  between nations  between cultures  between religions and between us and the natural world. We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are. We not do have more than this one planet. Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing  one or two projects only    in Tanzania  in Uganda  Kenya  South Africa  Congo Brazzaville  Sierra Leone  Cameroon and other groups. And as I say  it's in    countries around the world. Of course  they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables. They're working in the refugee camps  with chickens and selling the eggs for a little amount of money  or just using them to feed their families  and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment  because they're no longer helpless and depending on others with their vegetables and their chickens. It's being used in Uganda to give some psychological help to ex child soldiers. Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves. Once again  they're useful members of society. We have this program in prisons as well. So  there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now. But    oh  they're also working on HIV AIDS. That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots  with older kids talking to younger ones. And unwanted pregnancies and things like that  which young people listen to better from other youth  rather than adults. Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world   Jane  you've seen so many terrible things  you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number from about one million  at the turn of the century  to no more than         now  and the same with so many other animals. Forests disappearing  deserts where once there was forest. Do you really have hope   Well  yes. You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope  can you  And of course  there's hope. One is this amazing human brain. And I mean  think of the technologies. And I've just been so thrilled  finally  to come to people talking about compost latrines. It's one of my hobbyhorses. We just flush all this water down the lavatory  it's terrible. And then talking about renewable energy    desperately important. Do we care about the planet for our children  How many of us have children or grandchildren  nieces  nephews  Do we care about their future  And if we care about their future  we  as the elite around the world  we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day. What we buy. What we wear. And choose to make these choices with the question  how will this affect the environment around me  How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up  Or my grandchild  or whatever it is. So the human brain  coupled with the human heart  and we join hands around the world. And that's what TED is helping so well with  and Google who help us  and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park. All of these technologies we can use. Now let's link them  and it's beginning to happen  isn't it  You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen. This change  this change. To see change that we must have if we care about the future. And the next reason for hope    nature is amazingly resilient. You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed  with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate. And an example is the TACARE program. I told you  where a seemingly dead tree stump    if you stop hacking them for firewood  which you don't need to because you have wood lots  then in five years you can have a    foot tree. And animals  almost on the brink of extinction  can be given a second chance. That's my next book. It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope  and we've heard about this so much in the last two days  this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people  the resilience of the human spirit  So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty  or disease  or whatever  can pull themselves up out of it  sometimes with a helping hand  and take their part in society  and take their part in changing the world. And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring. We could make a very long list  but obviously Nelson Mandela  emerging from    years of hard physical labor     years of imprisonment  with this amazing ability to forgive  so that he could lead his nation out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath. Ken Saro Wiwa  in Nigeria  who took on the giant oil companies  and although people around the world tried their best  was executed. People like this are so inspirational. People like this are the role models we need for young Africans. And we need some environmental role models as well  and I've been hearing some of them today. So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message again  with everyone at TED. And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things  especially the Roots and Shoots program. And just a last word on that    the young woman who's running this entire conference center  I met her today. She came up so excited  with her certificate. She was  in  Roots and Shoots. She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam. She said it's helped her to do what she's doing. And it was very  very exciting for me to meet her and see just one example of how young people  when they are empowered  given the opportunity to take action  to make the world a better place  truly are our hope for tomorrow. Thank you. So  a big question that we're facing now and have been for quite a number of years now  are we at risk of a nuclear attack  Now  there's a bigger question that's probably actually more important than that  is the notion of permanently eliminating the possibility of a nuclear attack  eliminating the threat altogether. And I would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry  until this very moment  we've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that's characterized by two phases  which I'm going to go through with you right now. First of all  we started off the nuclear age in     . The United States had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the Manhattan Project  and the idea was very straightforward  we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror of this unending World War II that we'd been involved in in Europe and in the Pacific. And in       we were the only nuclear power. We had a few nuclear weapons  two of which we dropped on Japan  in Hiroshima  a few days later in Nagasaki  in August       killing about         people between those two. And for a few years  we were the only nuclear power on Earth. But by       the Soviet Union had decided it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power  and they began to match what the United States had developed. And from      to      was an extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagined back in the     s. So by         each of those red bombs up here is equivalent of a thousands warheads    the world had        nuclear warheads  and seven members of something that came to be known as the  nuclear club.  And it was an extraordinary time  and I am going to go through some of the mentality that we    that Americans and the rest of the world were experiencing. But I want to just point out to you that    percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since         going forward  of course    were part of the arsenals of the United States and the Soviet Union. After       and before the break up of the Soviet Union  we began to disarm from a nuclear point of view. We began to counter proliferate  and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world to about a total of       . It's a very difficult number to deal with  because what we've done is we've quote unquote  decommissioned  some of the warheads. They're still probably usable. They could be  re commissioned   but the way they count things  which is very complicated  we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before. But we also  in that period of time  added two more members to the nuclear club  Pakistan and North Korea. So we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal among many countries around the world  but a very different set of circumstances. So I'm going to talk about a nuclear threat story in two chapters. Chapter one is      to       when the Soviet Union broke up  and what we were dealing with  at that point and through those years  was a superpowers' nuclear arms race. It was characterized by a nation versus nation  very fragile standoff. And basically  we lived for all those years  and some might argue that we still do  in a situation of being on the brink  literally  of an apocalyptic  planetary calamity. It's incredible that we actually lived through all that. We were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym  which is MAD. It stands for mutually assured destruction. So it meant if you attacked us  we would attack you virtually simultaneously  and the end result would be a destruction of your country and mine. So the threat of my own destruction kept me from launching a nuclear attack on you. That's the way we lived. And the danger of that  of course  is that a misreading of a radar screen could actually cause a counter launch  even though the first country had not actually launched anything. During this chapter one  there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastrophe  and an indelible image was implanted in our collective minds that  in fact  a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could  in some ways  mean the end of civilization as we know it. So this was chapter one. Now the odd thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization obliteration  we engaged in America in a series    and in fact  in the Soviet Union    in a series of response planning. It was absolutely incredible. So premise one is we'd be destroying the world  and then premise two is  why don't we get prepared for it  So what we offered ourselves was a collection of things. I'm just going to go skim through a few things  just to jog your memories. If you're born after       this is just    consider this entertainment  otherwise it's memory lane. This was Bert the Turtle.  Video  This was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war  then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover. That was the principle. You    there would be a nuclear conflagration about to hit us  and if you get under your desk  things would be OK. I didn't do all that well in psychiatry in medical school  but I was interested  and I think this was seriously delusional. Secondly  we told people to go down in their basements and build a fallout shelter. Maybe it would be a study when we weren't having an atomic war  or you could use it as a TV room  or  as many teenagers found out  a very  very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend. And actually    so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters. Or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground. Now  the bomb shelters at that point    let's say you bought a prefab one    it would be a few hundred dollars  maybe up to      if you got a fancy one. Yet  what percentage of Americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house  What percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter  Less than two percent. About  .  percent of the population  as far as anyone knows  did anything  either making a space in their basement or actually building a bomb shelter. Many buildings  public buildings  around the country    this is New York City    had these little civil defense signs  and the idea was that you would run into one of these shelters and be safe from the nuclear weaponry. And one of the greatest governmental delusions of all time was something that happened in the early days of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  as we now know  and are well aware of their behaviors from Katrina. Here is their first big public announcement. They would propose    actually there were about six volumes written on this    a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the United States having three to four days warning that the Soviets were going to attack us. So the goal was to evacuate the target cities. We would move people out of the target cities into the countryside. And I'm telling you  I actually testified at the Senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate  and actually have three or four days' warning. It was just completely off the wall. Turns out that they had another idea behind it  even though this was    they were telling the public it was to save us. The idea was that we would force the Soviets to re target their nuclear weapons    very expensive    and potentially double their arsenal  to not only take out the original site  but take out sites where people were going. This was what apparently  as it turns out  was behind all this. It was just really  really frightening. The main point here is we were dealing with a complete disconnect from reality. The civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we'd see in all out nuclear war. So organizations like Physicians for Social Responsibility  around       started saying this a lot publicly. They would do a bombing run. They'd go to your city  and they'd say   Here's a map of your city. Here's what's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit.  So no possibility of medical response to  or meaningful preparedness for all out nuclear war. So we had to prevent nuclear war if we expected to survive. This disconnect was never actually resolved. And what happened was    when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear threat era  which started back in     . Chapter two starts in     . When the Soviet Union broke up  we effectively lost that adversary as a potential attacker of the United States  for the most part. It's not completely gone. I'm going to come back to that. But from      through the present time  emphasized by the attacks of       the idea of an all out nuclear war has diminished and the idea of a single event  act of nuclear terrorism is what we have instead. Although the scenario has changed very considerably  the fact is that we haven't changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means. So I'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second. So  what is a nuclear terror threat  And there's four key ingredients to describing that. First thing is that the global nuclear weapons  in the stockpiles that I showed you in those original maps  happen to be not uniformly secure. And it's particularly not secure in the former Soviet Union  now in Russia. There are many  many sites where warheads are stored and  in fact  lots of sites where fissionable materials  like highly enriched uranium and plutonium  are absolutely not safe. They're available to be bought  stolen  whatever. They're acquirable  let me put it that way. From      through       the International Atomic Energy Agency documented     cases of nuclear theft     of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium  the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon. The global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about        at the low end  to about       metric tons. More than     megatons of this is stored in particularly insecure Russian facilities. How much of that do you think it would take to actually build a    kiloton bomb  Well  you need about    pounds of it. So  what I'd like to show you is what it would take to hold    pounds of highly enriched uranium. This is not a product placement. It's just    in fact  if I was Coca Cola  I'd be pretty distressed about this       but basically  this is it. This is what you would need to steal or buy out of that     metric ton stockpile that's relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that was used in Hiroshima. Now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb. That    you'd need    to    pounds of plutonium. Now  plutonium     to    pounds  this. This is enough plutonium to create a Nagasaki size atomic weapon. Now this situation  already I    you know  I don't really like thinking about this  although somehow I got myself a job where I have to think about it. So the point is that we're very  very insecure in terms of developing this material. The second thing is  what about the know how  And there's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know how to actually make a nuclear weapon. Well  there's a lot of know how out there. There's an unbelievable amount of know how out there. There's detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts. There's books about how to build a nuclear bomb. There are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it. All of this information is relatively available. If you have an undergraduate degree in physics  I would suggest    although I don't  so maybe it's not even true    but something close to that would allow you  with the information that's currently available  to actually build a nuclear weapon. The third element of the nuclear terror threat is that  who would actually do such a thing  Well  what we're seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized. They are very dedicated and committed. They are stateless. Somebody once said  Al Qaeda does not have a return address  so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon  what's the response  and to whom is the response  And they're retaliation proof. Since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference  since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us  it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work. Here is Sulaiman Abu Ghaith  and Sulaiman was a key lieutenant of Osama Bin Laden. He wrote many  many times statements to this effect   we have the right to kill four million Americans  two million of whom should be children.  And we don't have to go overseas to find people willing to do harm  for whatever their reasons. McVeigh and Nichols  and the Oklahoma City attack in the     s was a good example of homegrown terrorists. What if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon  The fourth element is that the high value U.S. targets are accessible  soft and plentiful. This would be a talk for another day  but the level of the preparedness that the United States has achieved since      of '   is unbelievably inadequate. What you saw after Katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the United States is for any kind of major attack. Seven million ship cargo containers come into the United States every year. Five to seven percent only are inspected    five to seven percent. This is Alexander Lebed  who was a general that worked with Yeltsin  who talked about  and presented to Congress  this idea that the Russians had developed    these suitcase bombs. They were very low yield     .  to one kiloton  Hiroshima was around    kilotons    but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage. And Lebed came to the United States and told us that many  many    more than    of the suitcase bombs were actually not accountable. And they look like this. They're basically very simple arrangements. You put the elements into a suitcase. It becomes very portable. The suitcase can be conveniently dropped in your trunk of your car. You take it wherever you want to take it  and you can detonate it. You don't want to build a suitcase bomb  and you happen to get one of those insecure nuclear warheads that exist. This is the size of the  Little Boy  bomb that was dropped at Hiroshima. It was  .  feet long  weighed       pounds. You go down to your local rent a truck and for    bucks or so  you rent a truck that's got the right capacity  and you take your bomb  you put it in the truck and you're ready to go. It could happen. But what it would mean and who would survive  You can't get an exact number for that kind of probability  but what I'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening. Anybody who dismisses the thought of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves. I think there's a lot of people in the intelligence community    a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it's almost inevitable  unless we do certain things to really try to defuse the risk  like better interdiction  better prevention  better fixing  you know  better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth. There's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer. At this particular moment  we actually could end up seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities. I don't think we would see an all out nuclear war any time soon  although even that is not completely off the table. There's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the Earth many  many times over. There are flash points in India and Pakistan  in the Middle East  in North Korea  other places where the use of nuclear weapons  while initially locally  could very rapidly go into a situation where we'd be facing all out nuclear war. It's very unsettling. Here we go. OK. I'm back in my truck  and we drove over the Brooklyn Bridge. We're coming down  and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here  in the Financial District. This is a    kiloton bomb  slightly smaller than was used in Hiroshima. And I want to just conclude this by just giving you some information. I think     news you could use  kind of concept here. So  first of all  this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine. This is the ultimate. And if you're in the half mile radius of where this bomb went off  you have a    percent chance of not making it. If you're right where the bomb went off  you will be vaporized. And that's    I'm just telling you  this is not good. You assume that. Two mile radius  you have a    percent chance of being killed  and up to about eight miles away    now I'm talking about killed instantly    somewhere between a    and    percent chance of getting killed. The thing about this is that the experience of the nuclear detonation is    first of all  tens of millions of degrees Fahrenheit at the core here  where it goes off  and an extraordinary amount of energy in the form of heat  acute radiation and blast effects. An enormous hurricane like wind  and destruction of buildings almost totally  within this yellow circle here. And what I'm going to focus on  as I come to conclusion here  is that  what happens to you if you're in here  Well  if we're talking about the old days of an all out nuclear attack  you  up here  are as dead as the people here. So it was a moot point. My point now  though  is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here  if you've survived the initial blast. You have  when the blast goes off    and by the way  if it ever comes up  don't look at it. If you look at it  you're going to be blind  either temporarily or permanently. So if there's any way that you can avoid  like  avert your eyes  that would be a good thing. If you find yourself alive  but you're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon  you have    that's gone off    you have    to    minutes  depending on the size and exactly where it went off  to get out of the way before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up. In that    to    minutes  all you have to do    and I mean this seriously    is go about a mile away from the blast. And what happens is    this is    I'm going to show you now some fallout plumes. Within    minutes  it comes straight down. Within    hours  lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds  and it's mostly in this particular direction    it's going northeast. And if you're in this vicinity  you've got to get away. So you're feeling the wind    and there's tremendous wind now that you're going to be feeling    and you want to go perpendicular to the wind  not upwind or downwind . if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you. You've got to get out of there. If you don't get out of there  you're going to be exposed to lethal radiation in very short order. If you can't get out of there  we want you to go into a shelter and stay there. Now  in a shelter in an urban area means you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible  or you have to be on a floor    on a high floor    if it's a ground burst explosion  which it would be  higher than the ninth floor. So you have to be tenth floor or higher  or in the basement. But basically  you've got to get out of town as quickly as possible. And if you do that  you actually can survive a nuclear blast. Over the next few days to a week  there will be a radiation cloud  again  going with the wind  and settling down for another    or    miles out    in this case  over Long Island. And if you're in the direct fallout zone here  you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there  and that's clear. But if you are sheltered  you can actually survive. The difference between knowing information of what you're going to do personally  and not knowing information  can save your life  and it could mean the difference between         to         fatalities from something like this and half a million to         fatalities. So  response planning in the twenty first century is both possible and is essential. But in       there isn't one single American city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster. Part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves  personally  are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe. They are paralyzed. You say  nuclear  to them  and they're thinking   Oh my God  we're all gone. What's the point  It's futile.  And we're trying to tell them   It's not futile. We can change the survival rates by doing some commonsensical things.  So the goal here is to minimize fatalities. And I just want to leave you with the personal points that I think you might be interested in. The key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out  and not going into harm's way. That's basically all we're going to be talking about here. And the farther you are away in distance  the longer it is in time from the initial blast  and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere  the better. So separation    hopefully with dirt or concrete  or being in a basement    distance and time is what will save you. So here's what you do. First of all  as I said  don't stare at the light flash  if you can. I don't know you could possibly resist doing that. But let's assume  theoretically  you want to do that. You want to keep your mouth open  so your eardrums don't burst from the pressures. If you're very close to what happened  you actually do have to duck and cover  like Bert told you  Bert the Turtle. And you want to get under something so that you're not injured or killed by objects  if that's at all possible. You want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud  I said  in just a few minutes. And shelter and place. You want to move  only  crosswind for  .  miles. You know  if you're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed and down in that direction  less destroyed here  then you know that it was over there  the blast  and you're going this way  as long as you're going crosswise to the wind. Once you're out and evacuating  you want to keep as much of your skin  your mouth and nose covered  as long as that covering doesn't impede you moving and getting out of there. And finally  you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible. And if you're wearing clothing  you've taken off your clothing  you're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be    the radioactive material that might be on you. And then you want to stay in shelter for    to    hours minimum  but you're going to wait hopefully    you'll have your little wind up  battery less radio  and you'll be waiting for people to tell you when it's safe to go outside. That's what you need to do. In conclusion  nuclear war is less likely than before  but by no means out of the question  and it's not survivable. Nuclear terrorism is possible    it may be probable    but is survivable. And this is Jack Geiger  who's one of the heroes of the U.S. public health community. And Jack said the only way to deal with nuclear anything  whether it's war or terrorism  is abolition of nuclear weapons. And you want something to work on once you've fixed global warming  I urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable  inhumane reality of nuclear weapons in our world. Now  this is my favorite civil defense slide  and I       I don't want to be indelicate  but this    he's no longer in office. We don't really care  OK. This was sent to me by somebody who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures  but the fact of the matter is that America's gone through a very hard time. We've not been focused  we've not done what we had to do  and now we're facing the potential of bad  hell on Earth. Thank you. We really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children. If we don't do that  we're going to get the generation we deserve. They're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them. And we  as now the elite  parents  librarians  professionals  whatever it is  a bunch of our activities are  in fact  in trying to get the best we have to offer within reach of those around us  or as broadly as we can. I'm going to start and end this talk with a couple things that are carved in stone. One is what's on the Boston Public Library. Carved above their door is   Free to All.  It's kind of an inspiring statement  and I'll go back at the end of this. I'm a librarian  and what I'm trying to do is bring all of the works of knowledge to as many people as want to read it. And the idea of using technology is perfect for us. I think we have the opportunity to one up the Greeks. It's not easy to one up the Greeks. But with the industriousness of the Egyptians  they were able to build the Library of Alexandria    the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world. The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it. On the other hand  if you did  then great things happened. I think we can one up the Greeks and achieve something. And I'm going to try to argue only one point today  that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp. So if I'm successful  then you'll actually come away thinking  yeah  we could actually achieve the great vision of everything ever published  everything that was ever meant for distribution  available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it. Yes  there's issues about how money should be distributed  and that's still being refigured out. But I'd say there's plenty of money  and there's plenty of demand  so we can actually achieve that. But I'm going to go over the technological  social and sort of where are we as a whole  trying to get to that particular vision. And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website  the books  music  video and just go step    media type by media type  just go and say  all right  how're we doing on this  So if we start with books  you know  sort of where are we  Well  first you have to  as an engineer  scope the problem. How big is it  If you wanted to put all of the published works online so that anybody could have it available  well  how big a problem is it  Well  we don't really know  but the largest print library in the world is the Library of Congress. It's    million volumes     million volumes. It is  by far and away  the largest print library in the world. And a book  if you had a book  is about a megabyte  so    you know  if you had it in Microsoft Word. So a megabyte     million megabytes is    terabytes    it goes mega   giga   tera .    terabytes.    terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big  on spinning Linux drives  and it costs about        dollars. So for the cost of a house    or around here  a garage    you can put  you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress. That's pretty neat. Then the question is  what do you get  You know  is it worth trying to get there  Do you actually want it online  Some of the first things that people do is they make book readers that allow you to search inside the books  and that's kind of fun. And you can download these things  and look around them in new and different ways. And you can get at them remotely  if you happen to have a laptop. There's starting to be some of these sort of page turn y interfaces that look a whole lot like books in certain ways  and you can search them  make little tabs  and it's kind of cute    still very book like    on your laptop. But I don't know  reading things on a laptop    whenever I pull up my laptop  it always feels like work. I think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great. I don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle. It's starting to be a little bit more specified. But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like. I like the physical book. And I think we can go and use our technology to go and digitize things  put them on the Net  and then download  print them and bind them  and end up with books again. And we sort of said  well  how hard is this  And it turns out to not be very hard. We actually went off to make a bookmobile. And a bookmobile    the size of a van with a satellite dish  a printer  binder and cutter  and kids make their own books. It costs about three dollars to download  print and bind a normal  old book. And they actually come out kind of nice looking. You can actually get really good looking books for on the order of one penny per page  sort of the parts cost for doing this. So the idea of    this technology actually may end up putting books back in people's hands again. There are some other bookmobiles running around. This is Eric Eldred making books at Walden Pond    Thoreau's works. This is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services  for competing with the bookstore there. In India  they've got another couple bookmobiles running around. And this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria  the new Library of Alexandria  in Egypt. It was quite popularly attended. And kids starting to make their own books  and a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned. So the idea of being able to use this technology to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro  but I think it still has its place. And being from the Silicon Valley  sort of utopian sort of world  we thought  if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda  we might have something. So we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out. And we found in about    days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley  fly them to Uganda  buy a car  set up the first Internet connection at the National Library of Uganda  figure out what they wanted  and get a program going making books in rural Uganda. And it actually    so technologically  it works. What we found out of this is we didn't have the right books. So the books were in the library. We could get it to people  if they're digitized  but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized. Everybody thought the answer is  send things to India and China. And so we've tried that  and I'll go over that in a moment. There are some newer technologies for delivering that have happened that are actually quite exciting as well. One is a print on demand machine that looks like a Rube Goldberg machine. We have one of these things now. It's completely cool. It's all conveyor belt  and it makes a book. And it's called the  Espresso Book Machine   and in about    minutes  you can press a button and make a book. Something else I'm quite excited about in this particular domain  beyond these sort of kiosk y things where you can get books on demand  is some of these new little screens that are coming out. And one of my favorites in this is the      laptop. And I don't mean to steal any thunder here  but we've gone and used one of these things to be an e book reader. So here's one of the beta units and you can    it actually turns out to be a really good looking e book reader. And we have a quick hack that we did to try to put one of our books on it  and it turns out that     dots per inch means that you can put scanned books on them that look really good. At     dots per inch  it's kind of the equivalent of a     dot print laser printer. We're in good enough shape. You actually can go and read scanned books quite easily. So the idea of electronic books is starting to come about. But how do you go about doing all this scanning  So we thought  okay  well  let's try out this send books to India thing. And there was a project with  funded by the National Science Foundation    sent a bunch of scanners  and the American libraries were supposed to send books. Well  they didn't. They didn't want to send their books. So we bought         books and sent them to India. And then we learned why you don't want to send books to India. The lesson we learned out of this is  scan your own books. If you really care about books  you're going to scan them better  especially if they're valuable books. If they're new books and you can just  you know  butcher them  because you could just buy another one  that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high quality scanning. But do things that you love. But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books    about         now    doing very well. The Chinese did over a million  and the Egyptians are about       . But we sent    thought  OK  if we're going to need to do this  let's do it in library. How do we go and do this  and how do we get it down so that it's a cost point that we could afford  And we sort of picked the price point of    cents a page. If it's basically the cost of xeroxing to basically digitize  OCR  package it up  make it so that you could download  print and bind it    the whole shebang    we would have achieved something. So we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to    cents  And we tried these robot things  and they worked pretty well    sort of these auto page turning things. If we can have Mars Rovers  you'd think you could turn pages. But it actually turns out to be pretty hard to turn pages  and the volume isn't there. So anyway    so we ended up making our own book scanner  and with two digital  high grade  professional digital cameras  controlled museum lighting  so even if it's a black and white book  you can go and get the proper intonation. So you basically do a beautiful  respectful job. This is not a fax  this is    the idea is to do a beautiful job as you're going through these libraries. And we've been able to achieve    cents a page if we run things in volume. This is what it looks like at the University of Toronto. And actually  it turns out to  you know  pay a living wage. People seem to love it. Yes  it's a little boring  but some people kind of get into the Zen of it. And especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about  in languages that you can read. We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this  at getting    cents a page. So    cents a page      pages in your average book     dollars a book. The Library of Congress  if you did the whole darn thing       million books    is about     million dollars  right  But a million books  I think  actually would be a pretty good start  and that would cost    million dollars. That's not that big a bill. And what we've been able to do is get into libraries. We've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries  and libraries are up for having their books scanned. The Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA  which is where we have one these scanning centers  and scanning their out of copyright books  which is fabulous. So we're starting to get the institutional responsibility. The thing we're missing is the    cents. If we can get the    cents  all the rest of it flows. We've scanned about         books. Now we're scanning about        books a month  and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there. So all in all  that's going very well. And we're starting to move out of the just out of copyright into the out of print world. So I think of    we're kind of going from the out of copyright  library stuff  and Amazon.com is coming from the in print world. And I think we'll meet in the middle some place  and have the classic thing that you have  which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel. And so we're starting up a program to do out of print works  but loaning them. Exactly what loaning means  I'm not quite sure. But anyway  loaning out of print works from the Boston Public Library  the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries that are starting to participate in this program  to try out this model of where does a library stop and where does the bookstore take over. So all in all  it's possible to do this in large scale. We're also going back over microfilm and getting that online. So  we can do    cents a page  we're going        books a month and we've got about         books online  counting all the other projects that are starting to add in. So what I wanted to argue is  books are within our grasp. The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal. Yes  it costs tens of millions  low hundreds of millions  but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online. And then  there's business model issues about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people. But it is within our grasp  technologically and law wise  at least for the out of print and out of copyright  we suggest  to be able to get the whole darn thing online. Now let's go for audio  and I'm going to go through these. So how much is there  Well  as best we can tell  there are about two to three million disks having been published    so   s  long playing records and CDs    or at least that's the largest archives of published materials we've been able to sort of point at. It costs about    dollars a piece to go and take a disk and put it online  if you're doing things in volume. But we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny. This is a fairly heavily litigated area  so we've found that there are niches in the music world that aren't served terribly well by the classic commercial publishing system. And we've been starting to make these available by going and offering shelf space on the Net. In the United States  it doesn't cost you to give something away. Right  If you give something to a charity or to the public  you get a pat on the back and a tax donation    except on the Net  where you can go broke. If you put up a video of your garage band  and it starts getting heavily accessed  you can lose your guitars or your house. This doesn't make any sense. So we've offered unlimited storage  unlimited bandwidth  forever  for free  to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library. And we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers. The rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing  as long as nobody made any money. You could    concert recordings  it's not the commercial recordings  but concert recordings  started by the Grateful Dead. And we get about two or three bands a day signing up. They give permission  and we get about    or    concerts a day. We have about        concerts  everything the Grateful Dead ever did  up on the Net  so that people can see it and listen to this material. So audio is possible to put up  but the rights issues are really pretty thorny. We've got a lot of collections now    a couple hundred thousand items    and it's growing over time. Moving images  if you think of theatrical releases  there are not that many of them. As best we can tell  there are about         to         movies ever that are really meant for a large scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many. But half of those were Indian. But anyway  it's doable  but we've only found about a thousand of these things that    to be out of copyright. So we've digitized those and made those available. But we've found that there's lots of other types of movies that haven't really seen the light of day    archival films. We've found  also  a lot of political films  a lot of amateur films  all sorts of things that are basically needing a home  a permanent home. So we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular. We're not quite a YouTube. We tended towards longer term things and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies  which has just been great fun. Television comes quite a bit larger. We started recording    channels of television    hours a day. It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen. It's about a petabyte  so far  of worldwide television    Russian  Chinese  Japanese  Iraqi  Al Jazeera  BBC  CNN  ABC  CBS  NBC       hours a day. We only put one week up  which is mostly for cost reasons  which is the       sort of from          . For one week  what did the world see  CNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets. Were they  Let's look at the Palestinian television and find out. How can we have critical thinking without being able to quote and being able to compare what happened in the past  And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable  except by Jon Stewart  who does a fabulous job. So anyway  television is  I would suggest  within our grasp. So    dollars per video hour  and also about     dollars to     dollars per celluloid hour  we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively and have them up on the Net. And we've got  now  a lot of these materials. So we've got about         pieces up there. So books  music  video  software. There's only        titles of it. Mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections. But we've worked through some of those  but we've still got real problems in Washington. Well  we're best known as the World Wide Web. We've been archiving the World Wide Web since     . We take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it  every two months. And actually  it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet  which donates this collection to the Internet Archive. And it's been growing along for the last    years  and it's a fantastic resource. And we've made a Wayback Machine that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were. If you go and search on something    this is Google.com  the different versions of it that we have  this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release  and this is what it looked like at Stanford. So anyway  you've got basically an idea of where things came from. Mostly  people want to see their old stuff out of this. If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one  which is probably best known for burning  is  don't just have one copy. So we've started to    we've made another copy of all of this and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria. So this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria. And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam. So  we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco  flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right  so anyway ... so we're hedging our bets here. If we go and put it in a couple more places  I think we'll be in good shape. There's a political and social question out of this. Is all of this  as we go digital  is it going to be public or private  There's some large companies that have seen this vision  that are doing large scale digitization  but they're locking up the public domain. The question is  is that the world that we really want to live in  What's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward  How do we go and have a world where we both have libraries and publishing in the future  just as we basically benefited as we were growing up  So universal access to all knowledge    I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind  like the man on the moon  or the Gutenberg Bible  or the Library of Alexandria. It could be something that we're remembered for  for millennia  for having achieved. And as I said before  I'll end with something that's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library. Carnegie    one of the great capitalists of this country    carved above his legacy   Free to the People.  Thank you very much. David Gallo  This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo. And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video. We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen  and we're not going to show you any of it. The truth of the matter is that the Titanic    even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records    it's not the most exciting story from the sea. And the problem  I think  is that we take the ocean for granted. When you think about it  the oceans are    percent of the planet. Most of the planet is ocean water. The average depth is about two miles. Part of the problem  I think  is we stand at the beach  or we see images like this of the ocean  and you look out at this great big blue expanse  and it's shimmering and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides  but you have no idea for what lies in there. And in the oceans  there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet. Most of the animals are in the oceans. Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea  at the bottom of the sea. The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher  in places  than it is in the rainforests. It's mostly unexplored  and yet there are beautiful sights like this that captivate us and make us become familiar with it. But when you're standing at the beach  I want you to think that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world. We have to have a very special technology to get into that unfamiliar world. We use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras  and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony. Marcel Proust said   The true voyage of discovery is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes.  People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes  not only on what exists    the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea    but also how we think about life on the planet itself. Here's a jelly. It's one of my favorites  because it's got all sorts of working parts. This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans. It gets up to about     feet long. But see all those different working things  I love that kind of stuff. It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down. It's got tentacles dangling  swirling around like that. It's a colonial animal. These are all individual animals banding together to make this one creature. And it's got these jet thrusters up in front that it'll use in a moment  and a little light. If you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that  put them on one side of the scale  put all the jelly type of animals on the other side  those guys win hands down. Most of the biomass in the ocean is made out of creatures like this. Here's the X wing death jelly. The bioluminescence    they use the lights for attracting mates and attracting prey and communicating. We couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies. They come in all different sizes and shapes. Bill Lange  We tend to forget about the fact that the ocean is miles deep on average  and that we're real familiar with the animals that are in the first     or     feet  but we're not familiar with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom. And these are the types of animals that live in that three dimensional space  that micro gravity environment that we really haven't explored. You hear about giant squid and things like that  but some of these animals get up to be approximately          feet long. They're very little understood. DG  This is one of them  another one of our favorites  because it's a little octopod. You can actually see through his head. And here he is  flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up. We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths. They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet. They come right up to the submarine    they'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub. This is really a world within a world  and we're going to show you two. In this case  we're passing down through the mid ocean and we see creatures like this. This is kind of like an undersea rooster. This guy  that looks incredibly formal  in a way. And then one of my favorites. What a face  This is basically scientific data that you're looking at. It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes. And that's one of the things that Bill's been doing  is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this  in the world where they belong. They don't catch them in a net. They're actually looking at them down in that world. We're going to take a joystick  sit in front of our computer  on the Earth  and press the joystick forward  and fly around the planet. We're going to look at the mid ocean ridge  a        mile long mountain range. The average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half. And we're over the Atlantic    that's the ridge right there    but we're going to go across the Caribbean  Central America  and end up against the Pacific  nine degrees north. We make maps of these mountain ranges with sound  with sonar  and this is one of those mountain ranges. We're coming around a cliff here on the right. The height of these mountains on either side of this valley is greater than the Alps in most cases. And there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet. This is a volcanic ridge. We're getting down further and further in scale. And eventually  we can come up with something like this. This is an icon of our robot  Jason  it's called. And you can sit in a room like this  with a joystick and a headset  and drive a robot like that around the bottom of the ocean in real time. One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners is to bring this virtual world    this world  this unexplored region    back to the laboratory. Because we see it in bits and pieces right now. We see it either as sound  or we see it as video  or we see it as photographs  or we see it as chemical sensors  but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture. Here's where Bill's cameras really do shine. This is what's called a hydrothermal vent. And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed  hydrogen sulfide rich water coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor. Gets up to          degrees F  somewhere in that range. So that's all water under the sea    a mile and a half  two miles  three miles down. And we knew it was volcanic back in the '  s  '  s. And then we had some hint that these things existed all along the axis of it  because if you've got volcanism  water's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor  come in contact with magma  and come shooting out hot. We weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides  hydrogen sulfides. We didn't have any idea about these things  which we call chimneys. This is one of these hydrothermal vents. Six hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth. On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps  so the setting here is very dramatic. BL  The white material is a type of bacteria that thrives at     degrees C. DG  I think that's one of the greatest stories right now that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea  is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor after a volcanic eruption is bacteria. And we started to wonder for a long time  how did it all get down there  What we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth. Not only is it coming out of the Earth    so  biogenesis made from volcanic activity    but that bacteria supports these colonies of life. The pressure here is       pounds per square inch. A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles    no sun has ever gotten down here. All the energy to support these life forms is coming from inside the Earth    so  chemosynthesis. And you can see how dense the population is. These are called tube worms. BL  These worms have no digestive system. They have no mouth. But they have two types of gill structures. One for extracting oxygen out of the deep sea water  another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria  which takes the hydrothermal fluid    that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom    and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest. DG  You can see  here's a crab that lives down there. He's managed to grab a tip of these worms. Now  they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them. Oh  Good going. So  as soon as a crab touches them  they retract down into their shells  just like your fingernails. There's a whole story being played out here that we're just now beginning to have some idea of because of this new camera technology. BL  These worms live in a real temperature extreme. Their foot is at about     degrees C and their head is out at three degrees C  so it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water. That's how they like to live. DG  This is a female of this kind of worm. And here's a male. You watch. It doesn't take long before two guys here    this one and one that will show up over here    start to fight. Everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea. There are never any lights there  except the lights that we bring. Here they go. On one of the last dive series  we counted     species in these areas        were new  new species. BL  One of the big problems is that for the biologists working at these sites  it's rather difficult to collect these animals. And they disintegrate on the way up  so the imagery is critical for the science. DG  Two octopods at about two miles depth. This pressure thing really amazes me    that these animals can exist there at a depth with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can. What we saw up till now was from the Pacific. This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth. You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here  and he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack  And the same thing's going on over here. What they're getting at is that    on the back of this crab    the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria that lives on the backs of all these animals. And what these shrimp are trying to do is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals. And the crabs don't like it at all. These long filaments that you see on the back of the crab are actually created by the product of that bacteria. So  the bacteria grows hair on the crab. On the back  you see this again. The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents. Those are all shrimp. You see the hot water over here  here and here  coming out. They're clinging to a rock face and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face. Here's a tiny  little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar. Those pillars get up to several stories. So here  you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes  inhabited by these very strange animals that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground. They don't need the sun at all. BL  You see this white V shaped mark on the back of the shrimp  It's actually a light sensing organ. It's how they find the hydrothermal vents. The vents are emitting a black body radiation    an IR signature    and so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances. DG  All this stuff is happening along that        mile long mountain range that we're calling the ribbon of life  because just even today  as we speak  there's life being generated there from volcanic activity. This is the first time we've ever tried this any place. We're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific. We're moving up one of these pillars. This one's several stories tall. In it  you'll see that it's a habitat for a lot of different animals. There's a funny kind of hot plate here  with vent water coming out of it. So all of these are individual homes for worms. Now here's a closer view of that community. Here's crabs here  worms here. There are smaller animals crawling around. Here's pagoda structures. I think this is the neatest looking thing. I just can't get over this    that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away. This stuff is toxic as hell  by the way. You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean  and it's coming out all from it. It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid  and it's being just dumped out  at incredible rates. And animals are thriving    and we probably came from here. That's probably where we evolved from. BL  This bacteria that we've been talking about turns out to be the most simplest form of life found. There are a number of groups that are proposing that life evolved at these vent sites. Although the vent sites are short lived    an individual site may last only    years or so    as an ecosystem they've been stable for millions    well  billions    of years. DG  It works too well. You see there're some fish inside here as well. There's a fish sitting here. Here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm  waiting for that worm to stick his head out. BL  The biologists right now cannot explain why these animals are so active. The worms are growing inches per week  DG  I already said that this site  from a human perspective  is toxic as hell. Not only that  but on top    the lifeblood    that plumbing system turns off every year or so. Their plumbing system turns off  so the sites have to move. And then there's earthquakes  and then volcanic eruptions  on the order of one every five years  that completely wipes the area out. Despite that  these animals grow back in about a year's time. You're talking about biodensities and biodiversity  again  higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life. Is it sensitive  Yes. Is it fragile  No  it's not really very fragile. I'll end up with saying one thing. There's a story in the sea  in the waters of the sea  in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor. It's an incredible story. What we see when we look back in time  in those sediments and rocks  is a record of Earth history. Everything on this planet    everything    works by cycles and rhythms. The continents move apart. They come back together. Oceans come and go. Mountains come and go. Glaciers come and go. El Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster  it's rhythmic. What we're learning now  it's almost like a symphony. It's just like music    it really is just like music. And what we're learning now is that you can't listen to a five billion year long symphony  get to today and say   Stop  We want tomorrow's note to be the same as it was today.  It's absurd. It's just absurd. So  what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going at all these different scales and work with it. Learn to manage it. The concept of preservation is futile. Conservation's tougher  but we can probably get there. Thank you very much. Thank you. When I knew I was going to come to speak to you  I thought   I gotta call my mother.  I have a little Cuban mother    she's about that big. Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts. You still with me   Laughter  I called her up.  Hello  how're you doing  baby    Hey  ma  I got to talk to you.   You're talking to me already. What's the matter   I said   I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people.   You're always talking to nice people  except when you went to the White House.   Ma  don't start   And I told her I was coming to TED  and she said   What's the problem   And I said   Well  I'm not sure.  I said   I have to talk to them about stories. It's 'Technology  Entertainment and Design.'  And she said   Well  you design a story when you make it up  it's entertainment when you tell it  and you're going to use a microphone.  I said   You're a peach  ma. Pop there    What's the matter  The pearls of wisdom leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you   Then my pop got on there. My pop  he's one of the old souls  you know    old Cuban man from Camaguey. Camaguey is a province in Cuba. He's from Florida. He was born there in     . He grew up in a bohio of dirt floors  and the structure was the kind used by the Tainos  our old Arawak ancestors. My father is at once quick witted  wickedly funny  and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.  Papi  help.   I already heard your mother. I think she's right.   After what I just told you   My whole life  my father's been there. So we talked for a few minutes  and he said   Why don't you tell them what you believe   I love that  but we don't have the time. Good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to. Great story is the art of letting go. So I'm going to tell you a little story. Remember  this tradition comes to us not from the mists of Avalon  back in time  but further still  before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus  or we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist  damp caves. Back then  we had an urge  a need  to tell the story. When Lexus wants to sell you a car  they're telling you a story. Have you been watching the commercials  Because every one of us has this desire  for once    just once    to tell our story and have it heard. There are stories you tell from stages. There's stories that you may tell in a small group of people with some good wine. And there's stories you tell late at night to a friend  maybe once in your life. And then there are stories that we whisper into a Stygian darkness. I'm not telling you that story. I'm telling you this one. It's called   You're Going to Miss Me.  It's about human connection. My Cuban mother  which I just briefly introduced you to in that short character sketch  came to the United States one thousand years ago. I was born in       I forget  and I came to this country with them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution. We went from Havana  Cuba to Decatur  Georgia. And Decatur  Georgia's a small Southern town. And in that little Southern town  I grew up  and grew up hearing these stories. But this story only happened a few years ago. I called my mom. It was a Saturday morning. And I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal. It's delicious. It's savory. It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth    is that enough  It makes your armpits juicy  you know  That kind of food  yeah. This is the sensory part of the program  people. I called my mother  and she said   Carmen  I need you to come  please. I need to go to the mall  and you know your father now  he takes a nap in the afternoon  and I got to go. I got an errand to run.  Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you    Esther  my mother  had stopped driving several years ago  to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta. Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child  guys  naturally included flashing  blue lights. But she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue  and when she did meet them  oh  she had wonderful  well  rapport.  Ma'am  did you know that was a light you just ran    You don't speak English    No.  But eventually  every dog has its day  and she ended up in traffic court  where she bartered with the judge for a discount. There's a historical marker. But now she was a septuagenarian  she'd stopped driving. And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up to take her to have her hair dyed  you know  that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit  you know  same color as the Buick. Anybody  All right. Little picks on the legs  where she does her needlepoint  and leaves little loops. Rockports    they're for this. That's why they call them that. This is her ensemble. And this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning when I have a lot to do  but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing. I'm not going political on you but ... And so  I go to my mother's. I show up. She's in the carport. Of course  they have a carport. The kind with the corrugated roof  you know. The Buick's parked outside  and she's jingling  jangling a pair of keys.  I got a surprise for you  baby    We taking your car    Not we  I.  And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe. Somebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me. Oh  a driver's license  a perfectly valid driver's license. Issued  evidently  by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett. Blithering fucking idiots. I said   Is that thing real    I think so.   Can you even see    I guess I must.   Oh  Jesus.  She gets into the car    she's sitting on two phone books. I can't even make this part up because she's that tiny. She's engineered an umbrella so she can    bam     slam the door. Her daughter  me  the village idiot with the ice cream cone in the middle of her forehead  is still standing there  slack jawed.  You coming  You no coming    Oh  my God.  I said   OK  fine. Does pop know you're driving    Are you kidding me    How are you doing it    He's got to sleep sometime.  And so we left my father fast asleep  because I knew he'd kill me if I let her go by herself  and we get in the car. Puts it in reverse. Fifty five out of the driveway  in reverse. I am buckling in seatbelts from the front. I'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots. I mean  I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert. I've got a white knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about  And she's whistling  and finally I do the kind of birth breathing    you know  that one  Only a couple of women are going uh huh  uh huh  uh huh. Right. And I said   Ma  would you slow down   Because now she's picked up the Highway      the perimeter around Atlanta  which encompasses now    there's seven lanes  she's on all of them  y'all. I said   Ma  pick a lane    They give you seven lanes  they expect you to use them.  And there she goes  right. I don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped. So  I think  hey  we can talk. It'll be a diversion. It'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse  maybe.  Mommy  I know you have been stopped.   No  no  what you talking about    You have a license. How long have you been driving    Four or five days.   Yeah. And you haven't been stopped    I did not get a ticket.  I said   Yeah  yeah  yeah  yeah  but come on  come on  come on.   OK  so I stopped at a light and there's a guy  you know  in the back.   Would this guy have  like  a blue uniform and a terrified look on his face    You weren't there  don't start.   Come on. You got a ticket    No.  She explained   The man     I have to tell you as she did  because it loses something if I don't  you know     he come to the window  and he does a thing like this  which tells me he's pretty old  you know. So I look up and I'm thinking  maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute.   Ma  are you still doing that    If it works  it works  baby. So  I say  'Perdon  yo no hablo ingles.' Well  wouldn't you know  he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps.  So he's talking to her  and at some point she says   Then  you know  it was it. That was it. It was done.   Yeah  What  He gave you a ticket  He didn't give you a ticket  What    No  I look up  and the light  she change.  You should be terrified. Now  I don't know if she's toying with me  kind of like a cat batting back a mouse  batting back a mouse    left paw  right paw  left paw  right paw    but by now  we've reached the mall. Now  you have all been at a mall during the holidays  yes  Talk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes. Audience  Yes. Carmen Agra Deedy  All right  then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory  praying to that saint of perpetual availability that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along  some guy's going to turn on the brake lights just as you pull up behind him. But that doesn't happen most of the time  right  So  first I say   Ma  why are we here    You mean  like  in the car    No  don't    why are we here today  It's Saturday. It's the holidays.   Because I have to exchange your father's underwear.  Now  see  this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking  that you really have to    you know  in my mind  it's a rabbit's warren  this woman's mind. Do I want to walk in  because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor    enough metaphors for you     somewhere  I may not get out. But you know.  Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now  And why  What is wrong with his underwear    It will upset you.   It won't upset me. Why  What  Is something wrong with him    No  no  no. The only thing with him is  he's an idiot. I sent him to the store  which was my first mistake  and he went to buy underwear  and he bought the grippers  and he's supposed to buy the boxers.   Why    I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children.   Oh  my God   Olivia  Huh  Huh  By now  we have now crawled another four feet  and my mother finally says to me   I knew it  I knew it. I'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you  Right there.  And she points out the passenger window  and I look out  and three    three    aisles down   Look  the Chevy.  You want to laugh  but you don't know    you're that politically corrected  have you noticed  Correct the other direction now  it's OK.  Look  the Chevy    he's coming this way.   Mama  mama  mama  wait  wait  wait. The Chevy is three aisles away.  She looks at me like I'm her  you know  her moron child  the cretin  the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly.  I know that  honey. Get out of the car and go stand in the parking space till I get there.  OK  I want a vote. Come on  come on. No  no. How many of you once in your    you were a kid  you were an adult    you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone  See  we're a secret club with a secret handshake. And years of therapy later  we're doing great. We're doing great. We're doing fine. Well  I stood up to her. This is    you know  you'd think by now I'm    and still holding  I said   No way  ma  you have embarrassed me my entire life.  Of course  her comeback is   When have I embarrassed you   And she's still talking while she puts the car in park  hits the emergency brake  opens the door  and with a spryness astounding in a woman her age  she jumps out of the car  knocks out the phone books  and then she walks around    she's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her    around the front of the car. She has amazing land speed for a woman her age  too. Before I know it  she has skiddled across the parking lot and in between the cars  and people behind me  with that kind of usual religious charity that the holidays bring us  wah wah wah wah.  I'm coming.  Italian hand signals follow. I scoot over. I close the door. I leave the phone books. This is new and fast  just so you    are you still with us  We'll wait for the slow ones. OK. I start  and this is where a child says to me    and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before  because this is my laconic child. A brevity  brevity of everything with this child. You know  she eats small portions. Language is something to be meted out in small phonemes  you know    just little hmm  hmm hmm. She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen. She wields great power. She listens  because that's what people who tell stories do first. But she pauses occasionally and says   How do you spell that  What year  OK.  When she writes the expose in about    years  don't believe a word of it. But this is my daughter  Lauren  my remarkable daughter  my borderline Asperger's kid. Bless you  Dr. Watson. She says   Ma  you got to look   Now  when this kid says I got to look  you know. But it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before. I grew up with this woman. I said   Lauren  you know what  give me a play by play. I can't.   No  mama  you got to look.  I got to look. You got to look. Don't you want to look  There she is. I look in bewildered awe  she's standing  those Rockports slightly apart  but grounded. She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse  and she is wielding it. She's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force of her little personality  in that crone ish voice  saying things like   Back it up  buddy  No  it's reserved   Ready  Brace yourselves. Here it comes.  No  my daughter  she's coming in the Buick. Honey  sit up so they can see you.  Oh  Jesus. Oh  Jesus. I finally come    and now  it's the South. I don't know what part of the country you live in. I think we all secretly love stories. We all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear. We want to curl up and say   Tell it to me  tell it to me. Come on  honey  tell it to me.  But in the South  we love a good story. People have pulled aside  I mean  they've come out of that queue line  they have popped their trunks  pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks. Bets are placed.  I'm with the little lady. Damn   And she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement. She is  after all  Cuban. I'm thinking   Accelerator  break. Accelerator  break.  Like you've never thought that in your life  Right  Yeah. I pull in. I put the car in park. Engine's still running    mine  not the car. I jump out next to her going   Don't you move    I'm not going anywhere.  She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy. I come out  and there's Esther. She's hugging the purse.  Que   Which means  what   and so much more.  Ma  have you no shame  People are watching us all around   right  Now  some of them you've got to make up  people. Secret of the trade. Guess what  Some of these stories I sculpt a little  here and there. Some  they're just right there  right there. Put them right there. She says this to me. After I say    let me refresh you     have you no shame    No. I gave it up with pantyhose    they're both too binding.  Yeah  you can clap  but then you're about    seconds from the end. I'm about to snap like a brittle twig  when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder. Intrepid soul. I'm thinking   This is my kid. How dare she  She jumped out of that car.  That's OK  because my mother yells at me  I yell at her. It's a beautiful hierarchy  and it works. I turn around  but it's not a child. It's a young woman  a little taller than I  pale green  amused eyes. With her is a young man    husband  brother  lover  it's not my job. And she says   Pardon me  ma'am     that's how we talk down there     is that your mother   I said   No  I follow little old women around parking lots to see if they'll stop. Yes  it's my mother   The boy  now  he says.  Well  what my sister meant     they look at each other  it's a knowing glance     God  she's crazy   I said   Spanish   and the young girl and the young boy say   No  no  honey  we just want to know one more thing.  I said   Look  please  let me take care of her  OK  because I know her  and believe me  she's like a small atomic weapon  you know  you just want to handle her really gingerly.  And the girl goes   I know  but  I mean  I swear to God  she reminds us of our mother.  I almost miss it. He turns to her on the heel of his shoe. It's a half whisper   God  I miss her.  They turn then  shoulder to shoulder  and walk away  lost in their own reverie. Memories of some maddening woman who was the luck of their DNA draw. And I turn to Esther  who's rocking on those 'ports  and says   You know what  honey    What  ma    I'm going to drive you crazy probably for about        more years  if you're lucky  but after that  honey  you're going to miss me.   SHIT  This is arguably the back end of the design of animals. But the reason I put this up here is because when I was in Africa last year  my wife and I were driving around  we had this wonderful guide  who showed us something that surprised both of us  and it was very revealing in terms of the fascination that comes with the design of animals. It turns out that in about the     s  the missionaries came to Africa to spread the word of Christianity  to teach English to the natives. And they brought blackboards and chalk. And I'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard  and I just used some chalk on there. And they brought quite a bit of this stuff. But over the years  the blackboards were fine  but they ran out of chalk. And this is a real crisis for them. And that's where the hyena comes in. The hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world. It strip mines carcasses  and it has amazing teeth  because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones. Now  the end product of that action is up on the board here. What the missionaries would do is  they'd walk around and they'd pick up hyena shit. And the incredible thing about hyena shit is  it makes great chalk. That's not what I'm here to talk about  but it is a fascinating aspect of animal design. What I'm here to talk about is the camel. When I started talking to Richard about what I was going to speak about  I had recently come back from Jordan  where I had an amazing experience with a camel. And we were in the desert. Richard Wurman  That's the end  Keith Bellows  Yeah  yeah. We were in the desert  in Wadi Rum  in a small Jeep. There were four of us  two Bedouin drivers. You can just imagine  this expanse is an ocean of sand      degrees  one water bottle. And we were driving in what they told us was their very  very best Jeep. Didn't look like it to me. And as we started to go through the desert  the Jeep broke down. The guys got out  they put the hood up  they started working under the hood  got it going again. About a hundred yards  it broke down. This went on about     times  we were getting more and more alarmed  we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert. And eventually  our worst nightmare happened  they flooded the engine. And they said   Ah  no problem  We just get out and walk.  And we said   We get out and walk   One water bottle  remember  guys  four people. And they said   Yeah  yeah  we'll walk. We'll find some camels.  We got out and walked  and sure enough  about half a mile  we came over the crest of this hill  and there was a huge gathering of Bedouin with their camels. The guy went up and started dickering  and    dollars later  we had four camels. They went down like elevators  we got on them. They went back up  and the Bedouin  each Bedouin  four of them  got behind each of the camels with a little whip. And they started slashing away at the back of the camels  and they started galloping. And if you've ever been on a camel  it is a very  very uncomfortable ride. There's also one other aspect about these camels. About every    steps  they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg. So we kept on going  and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg. And eventually  three miles later  we arrived at our destination  where a Jeep was supposed to meet us. And the camels come down again like elevators  we sort of clumsily get off  and they  obviously  try to take another chunk out of my leg. And I've developed a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point  and I've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch. And much meaner  by the way  than the Bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell me one of his    daughters to take back to the States. So as we talked  Richard and I  I said   You know  maybe I should bring a camel. It's the best designed animal in the world.  He went   Nah. I don't think we want to be bringing a camel.  And you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel. So I did the next best thing. I went to the Washington Zoo. Richard said   I want you to get up close and personal with this camel. I want you to inspect its mouth  look at its teeth. Go underneath it. Go above it. Go around it. Pull its tail up  take a look in there. I want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can.  So  I got a National Geographic film crew. We went down there  and I took one look at this camel. It is a       pound creature who is in rut. Now  if you've ever seen a       pound camel in rut  it is a scary  scary thing to behold. And if Richard thought I was getting in the ring with that camel  someone was smoking Bedouin high grade. So we got as close to it as possible  and I'm going to share this. Chris  if you want to roll this film. Then I'm going to show you a little bit more about the design of camels. Do you want to roll the film  with the TED National Geographic Camel Investigation Unit. I'm here to look at the ultimate desert machine. Keith Bellows  And you'll note I started chewing gum because I was around this camel all day. See  now he's getting a little overexcited. So we'll need to be very careful around him. Don't let him get you. Now  you can see copious amounts of saliva in there. I always called myself the unstable stable boy. Their nose  you can see his nose is flared right now. When they're in rut  they're similar to seals in the way  like  a seal has to open its nose to breathe. And they're similar. They have to consciously open their nose. KB  Ears  SK  They are small. But they have excellent hearing. But not big  for instance  in zebras  they have a huge ear that's very mobile  so they can actually turn them both around. And they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision. They use that to pinpoint sound. The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold. So not only do they have the very long eyelashes  but there's the secondary    I guess you'd call it the  unclear  or whatever. It's this hair that's above the eyes  and below it  it's longer. Most people think that the humps store water. They don't. They store fat. Now  I'm not a chemist  but basically what happens is the fat is oxidized by their breathing. And that will turn it into actually usable water. Like a lot of predators  they walk on their toes. But there's a big fat pad in there that squishes out. They're like sun shoes  but  you know  with sand. Hooves  They don't have traditional hooves  but they do have one  like  big nail. You can't really see too clear. The fur's kind of grown over. But they use their tails a lot  especially in rut. He will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive. I don't know why that would be  but it works for them. So  what the hell. Now  they will also defecate in certain areas. Generally  they poop wherever they want to  but during their rut  they will defecate in perimeter areas. I don't know if you've read or heard about the sub sonic sounds from elephants  you know what I mean  like   Br r r   These big  big rumbling sounds. He will do the same thing. You can actually see  right here  it will vibrate. We weigh our animals. Unfortunately  he's a very aggressive animal  so he's actually destroyed some of the scales. We had these big things that I weigh the bison on  for instance. I'm guessing that he's at least       pounds. But I would put him closer to      . He's basically a walking mulch pile. We're kind of like buds  but I'm also a male as well. KB  He sees you as competition  Senior Keeper  Yeah  exactly. And it makes him very dangerous at this time of year. Don't even think about it. Don't think about it  But now  we're going to meet. Out  Out  Out  No. Out  KB  What I didn't show you was  you got that swinging thing going  Well  and you're glad I didn't show you this. One of the other things about the camel's beautiful design is that its penis points backwards. That way the camel can dip its tail in the stream  and just whacker the entire area around him. And that's how he really marks his territory. Now  what you also didn't see was that    and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and  by the way  the camel's name is Suki. In the pen beside him is Jasmine. Jasmine has been his mate for some time. But on this particular occasion  it was very  very clear that as horny as Suki was  Jasmine was having none of it. And so we started thinking. Well  if poor old Suki is in search of a mate  what would Suki do to find the perfect mate  I'm going to show you another film. But before I do  I just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand  the ship of the desert. It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found  largely Mongolia and Sahara  that there are     words in Arabic to describe the camel. And if this is a creature that was designed by committee  it's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on. So here's what Suki would do in search of a mate. Can you roll it  please  Camel seeking camel Lusty beast desires attractive and sincere mate. I'm seven feet        lbs.  with brown hair and eyes  long legs    and I'm very well ... hung. I'm TED Camel. The perfect desert machine. I'm smartly designed. Eyelashes that keep out sand and a third eyelash that works like a windshield wiper. A distinguished nose    with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust and a groove that catches moisture. Amazingly full lips    that allow me to eat practically anything that grows. Callouses on my knees that let me kneel comfortably. Leathery chest pads that beat the heat. Short fur that keeps my skin cool. Long legs that allow heat to escape. And my hump  Ogden Nash once wrote   The camel has a single hump  the dromedary two  or else the other way around. I'm never sure. Are you   Here's a hint  Bactarian. Dromedary. My hump contains up to    lbs. of fat  but doesn't store H O. I'm built to last. I'm the go to animal when the oasis is dry. I usually won't sweat until my body reaches      F  enough to fry an egg. I'm able to lose     of my weight without dying. I'll drink   to   gallons of water a day. But go without for more than a month. I'm powerful. Able to pack up to     lbs. of cargo. Outrun a horse    And cover    miles on a good day. Camelot. Jackie O. once said that traveling by camel made riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane. Yet my large  soft feet allow me to navigate sand. I'm a good provider  too. Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God. No surprise. Tents and rugs are made of my hair. My dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory. My dung is burned as fuel. My milk is used for cheese.  Camels are like angels   a Bedouin once said. Thank you. I just want to leave you with one last thought  which is probably the most important thing to take away. Humans  the animal  are pretty lucky creatures because  by and large  we really don't have to adapt to our environment  we adapt our environment to us. And we've seen that repeatedly through this conference  not just this year  but in past years. But this creature that you've just seen ultimately adapts  and keeps adapting and adapting. I think when you look at the animal kingdom  that is one of the most remarkable things. It doesn't have an environment that adapts to it  it has to adapt to the environment. Ricky  thank you very much for having me. RW  That's terrific. Thank you. My thing with school lunch is  it's a social justice issue. I'm the Director of Nutrition Services for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have    employees and    locations        kids. I'm doing       meals a day and I've been doing it for two years  trying to change how we feed kids in America. And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today. These are some of my kids with a salad bar. I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there. Everyone says it couldn't be done. Little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar  big kids would spit in it    neither happened. When I took over this  I tried to really figure out  like  what my vision would be. How do we really change children's relationship to food  And I'll tell you why we need to change it  but we absolutely have to change it. And what I came to understand is  we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet  healthy food and healthy kids. And that if we don't do that  the antithesis  although we've heard otherwise  is we're really going to become extinct  because we're feeding our children to death. That's my premise. We're seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker. And the reason this is happening  by and large  is because of our food system and the way the government commodifies food  the way the government oversees our food  the way the USDA puts food on kids' plates that's unhealthy  and allows unhealthy food into schools. And by    tacitly  all of us send our kids  or grandchildren  or nieces  or nephews  to school and tell them to learn  you know  learn what's in those schools. And when you feed these kids bad food  that's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about. The way we got here is because of big agribusiness. We now live in a country where most of us don't decide  by and large  what we eat. We see big businesses  Monsanto and DuPont  who brought out Agent Orange and stain resistant carpet. They control    percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country. These are       companies control much of what's in our grocery stores  much of what people eat. And that's really  really a problem. So when I started thinking about these issues and how I was going to change what kids ate  I really started focusing on what we would teach them. And the very first thing was about regional food    trying to eat food from within our region. And clearly  with what's going on with fossil fuel usage  or when    as the fossil fuel is going away  as oil hits its peak oil  you know  we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should  or could  be moving food       miles before we eat it. So we talked to kids about that  and we really start to feed kids regional food. And then we talk about organic food. Now  most school districts can't really afford organic food  but we  as a nation  have to start thinking about consuming  growing and feeding our children food that's not chock full of chemicals. We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones. We can't keep doing that. You know  it doesn't work. And the results of that are kids getting sick. One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics. Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America is consumed in animal husbandry. We are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein every day. Seventy percent    it's unbelievable. And the result of it is  we have diseases. We have things like E. coli that we can't fix  that we can't make kids better when they get sick. And  you know  certainly antibiotics have been over prescribed  but it's an issue in the food supply. One of my favorite facts is that U.S. agriculture uses  .  billion pounds of pesticides every year. That means every one of us  and our children  consumes what would equal a five pound bag    those bags you have at home. If I had one here and ripped it open  and that pile I would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply  because of the way we consume produce in America. The USDA allows these antibiotics  these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply  and the USDA paid for this ad in Time magazine. Okay  we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT  but we know it wasn't good for you and me. And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply. And that has to change  you know. The USDA cannot be seen as the be all and end all of what we feed our kids and what's allowed. We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart. The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food. That's what I really try and get people to understand. I really try and teach it to kids. I think it's the most important. It's consuming food in a way in which we'll still have a planet  in which kids will grow up to be healthy  and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we're seeing. It really is just a new idea. I mean  people toss around sustainability  but we have to figure out what sustainability is. In less than     years  you know  just in a few generations  we've gone from being        being     percent     percent farmers to less than   percent of farmers. We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers     .  million prisoners   .  million farmers. And we spend        dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison  and school districts spend     dollars a year feeding a child. It's no wonder  you know  we have criminals. And what's happening is  we're getting sick. We're getting sick and our kids are getting sick. It is about what we feed them. What goes in is what we are. We really are what we eat. And if we continue down this path  if we continue to feed kids bad food  if we continue not to teach them what good food is  what's going to happen  You know  what is going to happen  What's going to happen to our whole medical system  What's going to happen is  we're going to have kids that have a life less long than our own. The CDC  the Center for Disease Control  has said  of the children born in the year         those seven  and eight year olds today    one out of every three Caucasians  one out of every two African Americans and Hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime. And if that's not enough  they've gone on to say  most before they graduate high school. This means that    or    percent of all school aged children could be insulin dependent within a decade. Within a decade. What's going to happen  Well  the CDC has gone further to say that those children born in the year      could be the first generation in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents. And it's because of what we feed them. Because eight year olds don't get to decide    and if they do  you should be in therapy. You know  we are responsible for what kids eat. But oops  maybe they're responsible for what kids eat. Big companies spend    billion dollars a year marketing non nutrient foods to kids.    billion dollars a year.        ads most kids see. They spend     dollars for every one dollar        dollars marketing foods that kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar marketing healthy  nutritious food. The result of which is kids think they're going to die if they don't have chicken nuggets. You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more  and more  and more. This is the USDA portion size  that little  tiny thing. And the one over there  that's bigger than my head  is what McDonald's and Burger King and those big companies think we should eat. And why can they serve that much  Why can we have    cent Big Gulps and    cent double burgers  It's because of the way the government commodifies food  and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non nutrient foods really  really cheap. Which is why I say it's a social justice issue. Now  I said I'm doing this in Berkeley  and you might think   Oh  Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley.  Well  this is the food I found    months ago. This is not even food. This is the stuff we were feeding our kids  Extremo Burritos  corn dogs  pizza pockets  grilled cheese sandwiches. Everything came in plastic  in cardboard. The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter. The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher  because if it didn't come in a can  it came frozen in a box. The USDA allows this. The USDA allows all of this stuff. In case you can't tell  that's  like  pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes. Chicken nuggets  Tater Tots  chocolate milk with high fructose  canned fruit cocktail    a reimbursable meal. That's what the government says is okay to feed our kids. It ain't okay. You know what  It is not okay. And we  all of us  have to understand that this is about us  that we can make a difference here. Now I don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets  but I'm sure you're rich if you did. But whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart  a giraffe  a star  Well  Tyson did  because there's no chicken in the chicken. And that they could figure it out  that we could sell this stuff to kids. You know  what's wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken  But this is what most schools serve. In fact  this may be what a lot of parents serve  as opposed to    this is what we try and serve. We really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food. We really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe. You know  that vegetables are actually colorful  that they have flavor  that carrots grow in the ground  that strawberries grow in the ground. There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush. You know  we have to change the way we teach kids about these things. There's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools doing farm to school programs. There's a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools. Now  in Berkeley  we've gone totally fresh. We have no high fructose corn syrup  no trans fats  no processed foods. We're cooking from scratch every day. We have    percent of our    thank you       percent of our stuff is organic and local. We cook. Those are my hands. I get up at   a.m. every day and go cook the food for the kids  because this is what we need to do. We can't keep serving kids processed crap  full of chemicals  and expect these are going to be healthy citizens. You're not going to get the next generation  or the generation after  to be able to think like this if they're not nourished. If they're eating chemicals all the time  they're not going to be able to think. They're not going to be smart. You know what  They're just going to be sick. Now one of the things that    what happened when I went into Berkeley is I realized that  you know  this was all pretty amazing to people  very  very different  and I needed to market it. I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent. And these calendars really started to lay out my program. Now I'm in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district. So this is a typical menu. This is what we're serving this week at the schools. And you see these recipes on the side  Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes. They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes. They also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias. If we're going to change children's relationship to food  it's delicious  nutritious food in the cafeterias  hands on experience    you're looking in cooking and gardening classes    and academic curriculum to tie it all together. Now you've probably garnered that I don't love the USDA  and I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid  this upside down pyramid with a rainbow over the top  I don't know. You know  run up into the end of the rainbow  I don't know what you do with it. So  I came up with my own. This is available on my website in English and Spanish  and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food. The really tiny hamburger  the really big vegetables. We have to start changing this. We have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference. We have cooking classes    we have cooking classrooms in our schools. And why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation  maybe two  of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food  one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer. What are kids learning  Where is the family time  Where is socialization  Where is discussion  Where is learning to talk  You know  we have to change it. I work with kids a lot. These are kids I work with in Harlem. EATWISE    Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating. We have to teach kids that Coke and Pop Tarts aren't breakfast. We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet of refined sugar  they go up and down  just like if they're on a diet of crack. And we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools. We have recycling in all of our schools. You know  the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important  we have to teach kids about in school. It has to be so much a part of them that they really get it. Because  you know what  many of us are sort of at the end of our careers  and we need to be giving these kids    these young kids  the next generation    the tools to save themselves and save the planet. One of the things I do a lot is public private partnerships. I work with private companies who are willing to do R   D with me  who are willing to do distribution for me  who are really willing to work to go into schools. Schools are underfunded. Most schools in America spend less than       dollars a year teaching a child. That comes down to under five dollars an hour. Most of you spend        dollars an hour for babysitters when you have them. So we're spending less than   dollars an hour on the educational system. And if we're going to change it  and change how we feed kids  we really have to rethink that. So  public and private partnerships  advocacy groups  working with foundations. In our school district  the way we afford this is our school district allocates .   percent of the general fund towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district allocated a half to one percent  we could start to really fix this program. We really need to change it. It's going to take more money. Of course  it's not all about food  it's also about kids getting exercise. And one of the simple things we can do is put recess before lunch. It's sort of this  duh  thing. You know  if you have kids coming into lunch and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess  you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside. And then  at one in the afternoon  they're totally crashing. These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up  because they haven't had lunch. So if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class  believe me  they're going to sit there and eat their lunch. We need to    we need to educate. We need to educate the kids. We need to educate the staff. I had    employees. Two were supposed to be cooks    none could. And  you know  I'm not that better off now. But we really have to educate. We have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again  because  of course  they don't    because we've had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long. We need    minute lunches    most schools have    minute lunches    and lunches that are time appropriate. There was just a big study done  and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and    in the morning. That is not lunchtime. You know  it's crazy. It's crazy what we're doing. And just remember  at very least tacitly  this is what we're teaching children as what they should be doing. I think if we're going to fix this  one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program. Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA  I think it should be under CDC. If we started to think about food and how we feed our kids as a health initiative  and we started thinking about food as health  then I think we wouldn't have corn dogs as lunch. Okay  Finance     on this  and this    I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece  because I think this is something we all have to understand. The National School Lunch Program spends   billion dollars feeding    million children a year. That number probably needs to double. People say   Oh my God  where are we going to get   billion   In this country  we're spending     billion dollars a year on fast food. We spend     billion dollars a year on diet aids. We spend    billion dollars on vegetables  which is why we need all the diet aids. We spend     billion dollars a year on diet related illness today  with nine percent of our kids having type   diabetes.     billion. So you know what  when we talk about needing   billion more  it's not a lot. That   billion comes down to two dollars and    cents    that's what the government allocates for lunch. Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead. That means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools    most schools     to    cents. In L.A.  it's    cents. So we're spending less than a dollar  OK  on lunch. Now I don't know about you  but I go to Starbucks and Pete's and places like that  and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars. One gourmet coffee  one  is more    we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week in our schools. You know what  We should be ashamed. We  as a country  should be ashamed at that. The richest country. In our country  it's the kids that need it the most  who get this really  really lousy food. It's the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can't even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food. And those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick. Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of. We can all make a difference. That every single one of us  whether we have children  whether we care about children  whether we have nieces or nephews  or anything    that we can make a difference. Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids  whether you take your kids  or grandchildren  or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers' market. Just do tastings with them. Sit down and care. And on the macro level  we're in what seems to be a    month presidential campaign  and of all the things we're asking all of these potential leaders  what about asking for the health of our children  Thank you. Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy. They go to see Michelangelo's  David   and when they finally come face to face with the statue  they both freeze dead in their tracks. The first guy    we'll call him Adam    is transfixed by the beauty of the perfect human form. The second guy    we'll call him Bill    is transfixed by embarrassment  at staring at the thing there in the center. So here's my question for you  which one of these two guys was more likely to have voted for George Bush  which for Al Gore  I don't need a show of hands because we all have the same political stereotypes. We all know that it's Bill. And in this case  the stereotype corresponds to reality. It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called openness to experience. People who are high in openness to experience just crave novelty  variety  diversity  new ideas  travel. People low on it like things that are familiar  that are safe and dependable. If you know about this trait  you can understand a lot of puzzles about human behavior. You can understand why artists are so different from accountants. You can actually predict what kinds of books they like to read  what kinds of places they like to travel to  and what kinds of food they like to eat. Once you understand this trait  you can understand why anybody would eat at Applebee's  but not anybody that you know. This trait also tells us a lot about politics. The main researcher of this trait  Robert McCrae says that   Open individuals have an affinity for liberal  progressive  left wing political views     they like a society which is open and changing     whereas closed individuals prefer conservative  traditional  right wing views.  This trait also tells us a lot about the kinds of groups people join. So here's the description of a group I found on the Web. What kinds of people would join a global community welcoming people from every discipline and culture  who seek a deeper understanding of the world  and who hope to turn that understanding into a better future for us all  This is from some guy named Ted. Well  let's see now  if openness predicts who becomes liberal  and openness predicts who becomes a TEDster  then might we predict that most TEDsters are liberal  Let's find out. I'm going to ask you to raise your hand  whether you are liberal  left of center    on social issues  we're talking about  primarily    or conservative  and I'll give a third option  because I know there are a number of libertarians in the audience. So  right now  please raise your hand    down in the simulcast rooms  too  let's let everybody see who's here    please raise your hand if you would say that you are liberal or left of center. Please raise your hand high right now. OK. Please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian. OK  about a    two dozen. And please raise your hand if you'd say you are right of center or conservative. One  two  three  four  five    about eight or   . OK. This is a bit of a problem. Because if our goal is to understand the world  to seek a deeper understanding of the world  our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder. Because when people all share values  when people all share morals  they become a team  and once you engage the psychology of teams  it shuts down open minded thinking. When the liberal team loses  as it did in       and as it almost did in       we comfort ourselves. We try to explain why half of America voted for the other team. We think they must be blinded by religion  or by simple stupidity. So  if you think that half of America votes Republican because they are blinded in this way  then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral matrix  in a particular moral matrix. And by the matrix  I mean literally the matrix  like the movie  The Matrix.  But I'm here today to give you a choice. You can either take the blue pill and stick to your comforting delusions  or you can take the red pill  learn some moral psychology and step outside the moral matrix. Now  because I know    OK  I assume that answers my question. I was going to ask you which one you picked  but no need. You're all high in openness to experience  and besides  it looks like it might even taste good  and you're all epicures. So anyway  let's go with the red pill. Let's study some moral psychology and see where it takes us. Let's start at the beginning. What is morality and where does it come from  The worst idea in all of psychology is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth. Developmental psychology has shown that kids come into the world already knowing so much about the physical and social worlds  and programmed to make it really easy for them to learn certain things and hard to learn others. The best definition of innateness I've ever seen    this just clarifies so many things for me    is from the brain scientist Gary Marcus. He says   The initial organization of the brain does not depend that much on experience. Nature provides a first draft  which experience then revises. Built in doesn't mean unmalleable  it means organized in advance of experience.  OK  so what's on the first draft of the moral mind  To find out  my colleague  Craig Joseph  and I read through the literature on anthropology  on culture variation in morality and also on evolutionary psychology  looking for matches. What are the sorts of things that people talk about across disciplines  That you find across cultures and even across species  We found five    five best matches  which we call the five foundations of morality. The first one is harm care. We're all mammals here  we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming that makes us really bond with others  care for others  feel compassion for others  especially the weak and vulnerable. It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm. This moral foundation underlies about    percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED. The second foundation is fairness reciprocity. There's actually ambiguous evidence as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals  but the evidence for people could not be clearer. This Norman Rockwell painting is called  The Golden Rule   and we heard about this from Karen Armstrong  of course  as the foundation of so many religions. That second foundation underlies the other    percent of the moral statements I've heard here at TED. The third foundation is in group loyalty. You do find groups in the animal kingdom    you do find cooperative groups    but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings. It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people who are able to cooperate  join together into groups  but in this case  groups that are united to fight other groups. This probably comes from our long history of tribal living  of tribal psychology. And this tribal psychology is so deeply pleasurable that even when we don't have tribes  we go ahead and make them  because it's fun. Sports is to war as pornography is to sex. We get to exercise some ancient  ancient drives. The fourth foundation is authority respect. Here you see submissive gestures from two members of very closely related species. But authority in humans is not so closely based on power and brutality  as it is in other primates. It's based on more voluntary deference  and even elements of love  at times. The fifth foundation is purity sanctity. This painting is called  The Allegory Of Chastity   but purity's not just about suppressing female sexuality. It's about any kind of ideology  any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body  by controlling what you put into your body. And while the political right may moralize sex much more  the political left is really doing a lot of it with food. Food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays  and a lot of it is ideas about purity  about what you're willing to touch  or put into your body. I believe these are the five best candidates for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind. I think this is what we come with  at least a preparedness to learn all of these things. But as my son  Max  grows up in a liberal college town  how is this first draft going to get revised  And how will it end up being different from a kid born    miles south of us in Lynchburg  Virginia  To think about culture variation  let's try a different metaphor. If there really are five systems at work in the mind    five sources of intuitions and emotions    then we can think of the moral mind as being like one of those audio equalizers that has five channels  where you can set it to a different setting on every channel. And my colleagues  Brian Nosek and Jesse Graham  and I  made a questionnaire  which we put up on the Web at www.YourMorals.org. And so far         people have taken this questionnaire  and you can too. Here are the results. Here are the results from about        American citizens. On the left  I've plotted the scores for liberals  on the right  those for conservatives  in the middle  the moderates. The blue line shows you people's responses on the average of all the harm questions. So  as you see  people care about harm and care issues. They give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board  but as you also see  liberals care about it a little more than conservatives    the line slopes down. Same story for fairness. But look at the other three lines. For liberals  the scores are very low. Liberals are basically saying   No  this is not morality. In group  authority  purity    this stuff has nothing to do with morality. I reject it.  But as people get more conservative  the values rise. We can say that liberals have a kind of a two channel  or two foundation morality. Conservatives have more of a five foundation  or five channel morality. We find this in every country we look at. Here's the data for       Canadians. I'll just flip through a few other slides. The U.K.  Australia  New Zealand  Western Europe  Eastern Europe  Latin America  the Middle East  East Asia and South Asia. Notice also that on all of these graphs  the slope is steeper on in group  authority  purity. Which shows that within any country  the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness. Everybody    I mean  we debate over what's fair    but everybody agrees that harm and fairness matter. Moral arguments within cultures are especially about issues of in group  authority  purity. This effect is so robust that we find it no matter how we ask the question. In one recent study  we asked people to suppose you're about to get a dog. You picked a particular breed  you learned some new information about the breed. Suppose you learn that this particular breed is independent minded  and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal  Well  if you are a liberal  you say   Hey  that's great   Because liberals like to say   Fetch  please.  But if you're conservative  that's not so attractive. If you're conservative  and you learn that a dog's extremely loyal to its home and family  and doesn't warm up quickly to strangers  for conservatives  well  loyalty is good    dogs ought to be loyal. But to a liberal  it sounds like this dog is running for the Republican nomination. So  you might say  OK  there are these differences between liberals and conservatives  but what makes those three other foundations moral  Aren't those just the foundations of xenophobia and authoritarianism and Puritanism  What makes them moral  The answer  I think  is contained in this incredible triptych from Hieronymus Bosch   The Garden of Earthly Delights.  In the first panel  we see the moment of creation. All is ordered  all is beautiful  all the people and animals are doing what they're supposed to be doing  where they're supposed to be. But then  given the way of the world  things change. We get every person doing whatever he wants  with every aperture of every other person and every other animal. Some of you might recognize this as the '  s. But the '  s inevitably gives way to the '  s  where the cuttings of the apertures hurt a little bit more. Of course  Bosch called this hell. So this triptych  these three panels portray the timeless truth that order tends to decay. The truth of social entropy. But lest you think this is just some part of the Christian imagination where Christians have this weird problem with pleasure  here's the same story  the same progression  told in a paper that was published in Nature a few years ago  in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gachter had people play a commons dilemma. A game in which you give people money  and then  on each round of the game  they can put money into a common pot  and then the experimenter doubles what's in there  and then it's all divided among the players. So it's a really nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues  where we're asking people to make a sacrifice and they themselves don't really benefit from their own sacrifice. But you really want everybody else to sacrifice  but everybody has a temptation to a free ride. And what happens is that  at first  people start off reasonably cooperative    and this is all played anonymously. On the first round  people give about half of the money that they can. But they quickly see   You know what  other people aren't doing so much though. I don't want to be a sucker. I'm not going to cooperate.  And so cooperation quickly decays from reasonably good  down to close to zero. But then    and here's the trick    Fehr and Gachter said  on the seventh round  they told people   You know what  New rule. If you want to give some of your own money to punish people who aren't contributing  you can do that.  And as soon as people heard about the punishment issue going on  cooperation shoots up. It shoots up and it keeps going up. There's a lot of research showing that to solve cooperative problems  it really helps. It's not enough to just appeal to people's good motives. It really helps to have some sort of punishment. Even if it's just shame or embarrassment or gossip  you need some sort of punishment to bring people  when they're in large groups  to cooperate. There's even some recent research suggesting that religion    priming God  making people think about God    often  in some situations  leads to more cooperative  more pro social behavior. Some people think that religion is an adaptation evolved both by cultural and biological evolution to make groups to cohere  in part for the purpose of trusting each other  and then being more effective at competing with other groups. I think that's probably right  although this is a controversial issue. But I'm particularly interested in religion  and the origin of religion  and in what it does to us and for us. Because I think that the greatest wonder in the world is not the Grand Canyon. The Grand Canyon is really simple. It's just a lot of rock  and then a lot of water and wind  and a lot of time  and you get the Grand Canyon. It's not that complicated. This is what's really complicated  that there were people living in places like the Grand Canyon  cooperating with each other  or on the savannahs of Africa  or on the frozen shores of Alaska  and then some of these villages grew into the mighty cities of Babylon  and Rome  and Tenochtitlan. How did this happen  This is an absolute miracle  much harder to explain than the Grand Canyon. The answer  I think  is that they used every tool in the toolbox. It took all of our moral psychology to create these cooperative groups. Yes  you do need to be concerned about harm  you do need a psychology of justice. But it really helps to organize a group if you can have sub groups  and if those sub groups have some internal structure  and if you have some ideology that tells people to suppress their carnality  to pursue higher  nobler ends. And now we get to the crux of the disagreement between liberals and conservatives. Because liberals reject three of these foundations. They say  No  let's celebrate diversity  not common in group membership.  They say   Let's question authority.  And they say   Keep your laws off my body.  Liberals have very noble motives for doing this. Traditional authority  traditional morality can be quite repressive  and restrictive to those at the bottom  to women  to people that don't fit in. So liberals speak for the weak and oppressed. They want change and justice  even at the risk of chaos. This guy's shirt says   Stop bitching  start a revolution.  If you're high in openness to experience  revolution is good  it's change  it's fun. Conservatives  on the other hand  speak for institutions and traditions. They want order  even at some cost to those at the bottom. The great conservative insight is that order is really hard to achieve. It's really precious  and it's really easy to lose. So as Edmund Burke said   The restraints on men  as well as their liberties  are to be reckoned among their rights.  This was after the chaos of the French Revolution. So once you see this    once you see that liberals and conservatives both have something to contribute  that they form a balance on change versus stability    then I think the way is open to step outside the moral matrix. This is the great insight that all the Asian religions have attained. Think about yin and yang. Yin and yang aren't enemies. Yin and yang don't hate each other. Yin and yang are both necessary  like night and day  for the functioning of the world. You find the same thing in Hinduism. There are many high gods in Hinduism. Two of them are Vishnu  the preserver  and Shiva  the destroyer. This image actually is both of those gods sharing the same body. You have the markings of Vishnu on the left  so we could think of Vishnu as the conservative god. You have the markings of Shiva on the right  Shiva's the liberal god. And they work together. You find the same thing in Buddhism. These two stanzas contain  I think  the deepest insights that have ever been attained into moral psychology. From the Zen master Seng ts'an   If you want the truth to stand clear before you  never be for or against. The struggle between for and against is the mind's worst disease.  Now unfortunately  it's a disease that has been caught by many of the world's leaders. But before you feel superior to George Bush  before you throw a stone  ask yourself  do you accept this  Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil  Can you be not for or against anything  So  what's the point  What should you do  Well  if you take the greatest insights from ancient Asian philosophies and religions  and you combine them with the latest research on moral psychology  I think you come to these conclusions  that our righteous minds were designed by evolution to unite us into teams  to divide us against other teams and then to blind us to the truth. So what should you do  Am I telling you to not strive  Am I telling you to embrace Seng ts'an and stop  stop with this struggle of for and against  No  absolutely not. I'm not saying that. This is an amazing group of people who are doing so much  using so much of their talent  their brilliance  their energy  their money  to make the world a better place  to fight    to fight wrongs  to solve problems. But as we learned from Samantha Power  in her story about Sergio Vieira de Mello  you can't just go charging in  saying   You're wrong  and I'm right.  Because  as we just heard  everybody thinks they are right. A lot of the problems we have to solve are problems that require us to change other people. And if you want to change other people  a much better way to do it is to first understand who we are    understand our moral psychology  understand that we all think we're right    and then step out  even if it's just for a moment  step out    check in with Seng ts'an. Step out of the moral matrix  just try to see it as a struggle playing out  in which everybody does think they're right  and everybody  at least  has some reasons    even if you disagree with them    everybody has some reasons for what they're doing. Step out. And if you do that  that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility  to get yourself out of this self righteousness  which is the normal human condition. Think about the Dalai Lama. Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama    and it comes from his moral humility. So I think the point    the point of my talk  and I think the point of TED    is that this is a group that is passionately engaged in the pursuit of changing the world for the better. People here are passionately engaged in trying to make the world a better place. But there is also a passionate commitment to the truth. And so I think that the answer is to use that passionate commitment to the truth to try to turn it into a better future for us all. Thank you. I think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others that I'm not going to talk about vaginas today. I began  The Vagina Monologues  because I was worried about vaginas. I'm very worried today about this notion  this world  this prevailing kind of force of security. I see this word  hear this word  feel this word everywhere. Real security  security checks  security watch  security clearance. Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure  What does anyone mean when they talk about real security  And why have we  as Americans particularly  become a nation that strives for security above all else  In fact  I think that security is elusive. It's impossible. We all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us. People change us. Nothing is secure. And that's actually the good news. This is  of course  unless your whole life is about being secure. I think that when that is the focus of your life  these are the things that happen. You can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle. You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time  as they might confuse you or challenge you. You can't open yourself to new experiences  new people  new ways of doing things    they might take you off course. You can't not know who you are  so you cling to hard matter identity. You become a Christian  Muslim  Jew. You're an Indian  Egyptian  Italian  American. You're a heterosexual or a homosexual  or you never have sex. Or at least  that's what you say when you identify yourself. You become part of an  us.  In order to be secure  you defend against  them.  You cling to your land because it is your secure place. You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it. You become your nation. You become your religion. You become whatever it is that will freeze you  numb you and protect you from doubt or change. But all this does  actually  is shut down your mind. In reality  it does not really make you safer. I was in Sri Lanka  for example  three days after the tsunami  and I was standing on the beaches and it was absolutely clear that  in a matter of five minutes  a    foot wave could rise up and desecrate a people  a population and lives. All this striving for security  in fact  has made you much more insecure because now you have to watch out all the time. There are people not like you    people who you now call enemies. You have places you cannot go  thoughts you cannot think  worlds that you can no longer inhabit. And so you spend your days fighting things off  defending your territory and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking. Your days become devoted to protecting yourself. This becomes your mission. That is all you do. Ideas get shorter. They become sound bytes. There are evildoers and saints  criminals and victims. There are those who  if they're not with us  are against us. It gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them. It gets easier to lock them up  force them to be naked  humiliate them  occupy them  invade them and kill them  because they are only obstacles now to your security. In six years  I've had the extraordinary privilege through V Day  a global movement against  violence against  women  to travel probably to    countries  and spend a great deal of time in different portions. I've met women and men all over this planet  who through various circumstances    war  poverty  racism  multiple forms of violence    have never known security  or have had their illusion of security forever devastated. I've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban  who were essentially brutalized and censored. I've been in Bosnian refugee camps. I was with women in Pakistan who have had their faces melted off with acid. I've been with girls all across America who were date raped  or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night. One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels is that there is this emerging species. I loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world. I've discovered these people  who  in V Day world  we call Vagina Warriors. These particular people  rather than getting AK   s  or weapons of mass destruction  or machetes  in the spirit of the warrior  have gone into the center  the heart of pain  of loss. They have grieved it  they have died into it  and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine. They have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy towards another mission and another trajectory. These warriors now devote themselves and their lives to making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else. There are thousands if not millions of them on the planet. I venture there are many in this room. They have a fierceness and a freedom that I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm. They have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator. Their own personal security is not their end goal  and because of that  because  rather than worrying about security  because the transformation of suffering is their end goal  I actually believe they are creating real safety and a whole new idea of security. I want to talk about a few of these people that I've met. Tomorrow  I am going to Cairo  and I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo who are V Day women  who are opening the first safe house for battered women in the Middle East. That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up and put themselves on the line  and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt  and were willing to be attacked and criticized. And through their work over the last years  this is not only happening that this house is opening  but it's being supported by many factions of the society who never would have supported it. Women in Uganda this year  who put on  The Vagina Monologues  during V Day  actually evoked the wrath of the government. And  I love this story so much. There was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents to talk about whether  Vaginas  could come to Uganda. And in this meeting    it went on for weeks in the press  two weeks where there was huge discussion. The government finally made a decision that  The Vagina Monologues  could not be performed in Uganda. But the amazing news was that because they had stood up  these women  and because they had been willing to risk their security  it began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda  but all of Africa. As a result  this production  which had already sold out  every single person in that     seat audience  except for    people  made a decision to keep the money. They raised        dollars on a production that never occurred. There's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota. She's a high school student. She had seen  The Vagina Monologues  and she was really moved. And as a result  she wore an  I heart my vagina  button to her high school in Minnesota. She was basically threatened to be expelled from school. They told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school  that it was not a legal thing  that it was not a moral thing  that it was not a good thing. So she really struggled with this  what to do  because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together    I believe it was          students all wore  I love my vagina  T shirts  and the boys wore  I love her vagina  T shirts to school. Now this seems like a fairly  you know  frivolous  but what happened as a result of that  is that that school now is forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex  it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly or to say that she loved her vagina publicly. I know I've talked about Agnes here before  but I want to give you an update on Agnes. I met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley. When she was a young girl  she had been mutilated against her will. That mutilation of her clitoris had actually obviously impacted her life and changed it in a way that was devastating. She made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard  but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls. For eight years  she walked through the Rift Valley. She had this amazing box that she carried and it had a torso of a woman's body in it  a half a torso  and she would teach people  everywhere she went  what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like. In the years that she walked  she educated parents  mothers  fathers. She saved       girls from being cut. When V Day met her  we asked her how we could support her and she said   Well  if you got me a Jeep  I could get around a lot faster.  So  we bought her a Jeep. In the year she had the Jeep  she saved       girls from being cut. So  we said  what else could we do  She said   If you help me get money  I could open a house.  Three years ago  Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation. When she began her mission eight years ago  she was reviled  she was detested  she was completely slandered in her community. I am proud to tell you that six months ago  she was elected the deputy mayor of Narok. I think what I'm trying to say here is that if your end goal is security  and if that's all you're focusing on  what ends up happening is that you create not only more insecurity in other people  but you make yourself far more insecure. Real security is contemplating death  not pretending it doesn't exist. Not running from loss  but entering grief  surrendering to sorrow. Real security is not knowing something  when you don't know it. Real security is hungering for connection rather than power. It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs. It is deeper  it is a process  it is acute awareness that we are all utterly inter bended  and one action by one being in one tiny town has consequences everywhere. Real security is not only being able to tolerate mystery  complexity  ambiguity  but hungering for them and only trusting a situation when they are present. Something happened when I began traveling in V Day  eight years ago. I got lost. I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa  and I had no idea where I was. I didn't know where I was going  where I'd come from  and I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack. And then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter where I was going  or where I had come from because we are all essentially permanently displaced people. All of us are refugees. We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time  moving towards a new place. Freedom means I may not be identified as any one group  but that I can visit and find myself in every group. It does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs  but it does mean I am not hardened around them. I do not use them as weapons. In the shared future  it will be just that  shared. The end goal will  be  becoming vulnerable  realizing the place of our connection to one another  rather than becoming secure  in control and alone. Thank you very much. Chris Anderson  And how are you doing  Are you exhausted  On a typical day  do you wake up with hope or gloom  Eve Ensler  You know  I think Carl Jung once said that in order to survive the twentieth century  we have to live with two existing thoughts  opposite thoughts  at the same time. And I think part of what I'm learning in this process is that one must allow oneself to feel grief. And I think as long as I keep grieving  and weeping  and then moving on  I'm fine. When I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me  and isn't changing my heart  then I get in trouble. Because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place  country to country  and city to city  the degree to which women  for example  are violated  and the epidemic of it  and the kind of ordinariness of it  is so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time  or I have to take the time now  to process that. CA  There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about  you know  poverty  sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one. Why this one  EE  I think that if you think about women  women are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth  we come from them  they are mothers  they are visionaries  they are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says that one out of three women on the planet will be raped or beaten in their lifetime  we're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet  we're talking about the place where we come from  we're talking about parenting. Imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child. How does it impact your ability to work  or envision a future  or thrive  as opposed to just survive  What I believe is if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women  it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself. Good morning. My name is David Rose. I am a serial entrepreneur turned serial investor. And by the use of pitching PowerPoints to VCs  I have personally raised tens of millions of dollars from VCs through PowerPoint pitches. And then  turning round to the other side of the equation  I have personally supervised the investment of tens of millions of dollars into companies who have been pitching me with PowerPoint presentations. So I think it's safe to say I know a little bit about the process of pitching. So  the very first question that you've all got to figure out is  what is the single most important thing that a VC is looking for when you come to them pitching your new business idea  And there are obviously all kinds of things. There are business models  and there are financials  and there are markets and there is that. Overall  of all the things that you have to do  what is the single most important thing the VC is going to be investing in  Somebody  What  David S. Rose  People  You  That's it    you are the person. And so therefore  the entire purpose of a VC pitch is to convince them that you are the entrepreneur in whom they are going to invest their money and make a lot of money in return. Now  how do you do this  You can't just walk up and say  you know   Hi  I'm a really good guy  and a good girl  and you should really invest in me.  Right  So  in the course of your VC pitch  you have a very few minutes  and most VC pitches    most angel pitches are about    minutes  most VC pitches should be less than half an hour. People's attention span after    minutes begins to drop off  tests have shown. So in that    minutes  or    minutes  or five minutes  you have to convey a whole bunch of different characteristics. You actually have to convey about    different characteristics while you're standing up there. What's the single most important thing you've got to convey  What  DSR  Boy  oh boy  oh boy  And that's a straight line we got right over there. And I didn't even prompt him. You're right  integrity. Because that's the key thing. I would much rather invest in somebody    you know  take a chance on somebody    who I know is straight than somebody where there's any possible question of  you know  who are they looking out for  and what's going on. So the most important thing is integrity. And what's the second most important thing after integrity  Let's see if you can get this one. DSR  Close enough  Passion. Right  so here you want    entrepreneurs by definition are people who are leaving something else  starting a new world over here  creating and putting their lifeblood into this kind of thing. You've got to convey passion. If you're not passionate about your own company  why on Earth should anyone else be passionate  Why should they put more money into your company  if you're not passionate about it  So  integrity and passion  the single most important things out there. Then there are a whole panoply of other things that you've got to do  to wrap up in this package that you're presenting to a VC. Experience. You've got to be able to say   Hey  you know  I've done this before.  And  done this before  is starting an enterprise and creating value  and taking something from beginning to end. So that's why VCs love to fund serial entrepreneurs. Because even if you didn't do it right the first time  you've learned the lessons  which are going to stand you in very good stead the next time. And now along with that  along with the experience of starting an enterprise  or running something    and it doesn't have to be a business. It can be in an organization at school  it can be a not for profit. But they want experience in creating an organization. Next up is knowledge. If you're telling me you're going to be the great developer of the map of the human genome  you'd better know what a human genome is. I mean  I want you to have domain expertise. So I don't want somebody who's saying   Hey  I've got a great idea in a business I know nothing about. I don't know who the players are. I don't know what the market is like.  So you've got to know your market. You've got to know your area. And then you have to have the skills that it takes to get a company going. And those skills include everything from technical skills  if it's a technology business  to marketing  and sales  and management  and so on. But  you know  not everybody has all these skills. There are very few people who have the full set of skills that it takes to run a company. So what else do you require  Well  leadership. You've got to be able to convince us that you either have developed a team that has all those factors in it  or else you can. And you have the charisma and the management style and the ability to get people to follow your lead  to inspire them  to motivate them to be part of your team. All right  then  having done all that  what else do I want to know as a VC  I want to know that you have commitment. That you are going to be here to the end. I want you to say  or I want you to convey  that you are going to die if you have to  with your very last breath  with your fingernails scratching as they drag you out. You're going to keep my money alive and you're going to make more money out of it. So I don't want somebody who's going to cut and run at the first opportunity. Because bad things happen. There's never been an angel  or a venture funded company where bad things didn't happen. So I want to know that you're committed to be there to the very end. You've got to have vision. You've got to be able to see where this is going. I don't want another  me too  product. I want somebody who knows  who can change the world out there. But on top of that  I also need realism. Because I need to know that you know that while changing the world is great  it doesn't always happen. And before you get to change the world  bad things are going to take place. And you've got to be able to deal with that. And you have to have rational projections and stuff. And then finally  you're asking for my money  not just because it's my money  but because it's me. You need to be coachable. So I need to know that you have the ability to listen. We've had a lot of experience. People who are VCs or angels investing in you have had experience and they'd like to know that you want to hear that experience. Okay  so how do you convey all these    things in    minutes without saying any more  You can't say   Hey  I've got high integrity  invest in me   Right  You've got to do a whole pitch that conveys this without conveying it. So think about your pitch as a timeline. It starts off  you walk in the door. They know nothing at all  whatsoever  about you. And you can take them on an emotional    all pitches  or all sales presentations  are emotional at some level. You can go up  you can go down  right  And it goes from beginning to end. You walk in the door. So the first thing you've got to do    the overall  you know  arc of your presentation    it's got to start like a rocket. You've got maybe    seconds    between    and    seconds  depending on how long the pitch is    to get their attention. In my case   I've invested. I have got tens of millions of dollars from PowerPoint pitches. I have invested tens of millions of dollars.  That's it    that should get you right there. This can be a factor  and everybody can be saying it's counterintuitive. It can be a story  it can be experience. But you've got to grab their emotional attention  focused on you  within that first few seconds. And then from there  you've got to take them on a very solid  steady  upward path  right from beginning to end. And everything has got to be reinforcing this. And you've got to get better  and better  and better  and better. And it's revving up to the very end  and then at the very end you've got to    boom     knock them out of the park. You want to be able to get them to such an emotional high that they are ready to write you a check  throw money at you  right there before you leave. Okay  so how do you do that  Well  first of all  logical progression. Any time you go backwards  any time you skip a step    imagine walking up a staircase where some of the treads are missing  or the heights are different heights. You stop  you've got to figure it out. You want a nice logical progression. Start with telling them what the market is. Why are you going to do X  Y or Z. And then you've got to tell me how you're going to do it  and what it is you're going to do. How you're going to do it. And the whole    it's got to flow from beginning to end. You've also got to let me know that there are touchstones. You want to tie in to the rest of the world out there. So  for example  if you reference companies I've heard of  or basic items in your business  I want to know about them. Things that I can relate to  validators  or anything that tells me somebody else has approved this  or there's outside validation. It can be sales  it can be you've got an award for something  it can be  people have done it before  it can be your beta tests are going great. Whatever. I want to know validation  that you're telling me not just what you're telling me  but that somebody else    or something else out there    says this makes sense. And then  because I'm looking for the upside here  I've got to have believable upside. And that's two parts. It's got to be upside  and it's got to be believable. The upside means that if you're telling me that you're going to be out there  five years out  making a million dollars a year    hmm. That's not really upside. Telling me you're going to be out there making a billion dollars a year    that's not believable. So it's got to be both sides. On the other hand  there are a lot of things that drive me down  take the emotional level down  and you've got to recover from those. And those  for example  are anything you tell me that I know is not true.  We have no competition. There's nobody else who's ever made a widget like this.  Odds are I probably know somebody who has made a widget. And the minute you tell me that    boom  You know  I discount half of what you're saying from then on. Anything that makes me think. Anything that I don't understand  where I have to make the leap myself  in my own head  is going to stop the flow of the presentation. So  you've got to take me through like a sixth grader    dub  dub  dub  dub  dub    but without patronizing me. And it's a very tricky path to do it. But if you can do it  it works really  really well. Anything that's inconsistent within the concept of your thing. If you tell me sales of X  Y or Z are    million dollars  and the next slide  or five slides later  they're five million dollars. Well  one may have been gross sales  one may have been net sales  but I want to know that all the numbers make sense together. And then finally  anything that's an error  or a typo  or a stupid mistake  or a line that's in the wrong place. That shows me that    if you can't even do a presentation  how the heck can you run a company  So this all feeds in together. All right  so the best way to do this stuff is to look at our betters  look at people who have done this before. So let's look at the most successful technology executive in the business and see how a presentation goes. Bill Gates' PowerPoint presentation over here. Here's Gates doing a thing for Windows. Is this the way you should do a PowerPoint presentation  What do you think  No. Who do you think we should look at as our role model  Oh  isn't that funny  There's another great one over here. Yes  OK  Steve Jobs. You want absolute    this is the Zen of presentation  right  Here he is. One little guy  black jeans and stuff  on a totally empty stage. What are you focusing on  You're focusing on him  This is Steve Jobs. So  you know  our great    these wonderful long bullet points  a whole list of things  you know    good  No  they're not. The long bullet points are bad. What's good  Short  short bullet points. But you know what  Even better than short bullet points are no bullet points. Just give me the headline over here. And you know what  How many bullet points or headlines does Steve Jobs use  Basically none. What do you do  Best of all  images. Just a simple image. I looked at the image    a picture's worth a thousand words. You look at the image and you see that  and you drop the whole thing. And then  you come back to me. And you're focused on me and why I'm such a great guy  and why you want to invest in me. And why this whole thing makes sense. So with that said  we only have a very  very short time. So let's run through the things you've got to include in your presentation. Well  first of all  start out. None of these big  long titled slides with blah  blah  blah  blah  blah  blah and I'm presenting to so and so  such and such a date. I know the day  I know who I am  I know you're presenting. I don't need all that. Just give me your company logo. I look at the logo  and it sort of ties it to my brain. And then I come back to you. I'm focused on you  OK  You do that  you give me your quick    second or    second intro  grab my attention. And then you want to give me a quick business overview. This is not a five minute pitch. This is  you know  two sentences.  We build widgets for the X  Y  Z market.  Or   We sell services to help somebody do X.  You know  whatever. And that is like the picture on the outside of a jigsaw puzzle box. That lets me know the context. It gives me the armature for the whole thing you're going to be going through. And it lets me put everything else in relation to something you've already told me. So there you go    walk me through  show me who your management team is. It's helpful that you've had experience and you've done this kind of thing before. And I want to know the market    the size of the market. Why is this market worth getting at over here  I want to know your product  and that's very important. Now  this is not a product pitch  not a sales pitch. I don't want to know all the ins and outs  and the gazuntas and the yaddas and stuff. I just want to know    what the heck is it  If it's a website  show me a screenshot of your website. You know  don't do a live demo. No  never do a live demo. Do a canned demo  or do something that lets me know why people are going to buy whatever it is. Then I want to know    now that I know what you're selling  tell me how you make money on it. For every X you sell  you get Y  you do your services of Z. I want to know what the business model is on a sort of per unit basis  or for the actual product that you're selling. I want to know who you're selling this thing to  in terms of customers. And I want to know if you have any relationships that are going to be special to help you. Whether you have a distribution relationship with somebody  you know  you have a producing partner. Or  you know  again  validation. This helps to say you're bigger than just one little thing over here. But then  everybody has competition. There has never been a company that doesn't have competition. Even if the competition is the old way of doing something. I want to know exactly what your competition is  and then that will help me judge how you fit into the whole operation over here. But then  I want to know how you're special. If I know what your competition does  how are you going to prevent your competition from eating your lunch over here  And then all this ties into the financial overview. And you have to have    you can't do a VC pitch without giving me your financials. I want to know three and  you know  a year or two back  or as long as you've been in existence. And I want to know three or four or five years forward. Five is a bit much. Probably four is rational. And I want to know how that business model that you showed me on a product basis is going to translate into a company model. And  you know  how many widgets are you going to sell  You're making X amount per widget. I want to know what the driver is. We're going to have       customers this year  and        next year. And our revenues are going to go this  that and the other thing. And so that gives me the whole picture for the next several years into which I'm investing. And I want to know how the money you're going to get from me is going to help you get there. You're going to open an offshore plant in China  you're going to spend it all on sales and marketing  you're going to go to Tahiti  or whatever out there. But then comes the ask. This is where you tell me how much you actually want to get. You're looking for   million    at what kind of valuation  Two million at        . What's the money in so far  Who invested  I hope you invested personally. Because I'm following on. If you can't invest in your own thing  why should I invest in it  So I like to know if you have friends and family  or angel investors in there  or you've had more VCs before. What's the capital structure up until this point  And then finally  having done all that  you've now told me the whole thing  so now you've got to bring it back to that conclusion. This is that rocket going up. So hopefully everything has been positive  positive  positive  more positive. And everything  everything you say clicks with me  and it all makes sense. And I'm thinking   This is really  really great.  And then you take me back to your logo. Just your logo on the screen. And I look at the logo    okay  good. Now I come back to you. Nothing else to look at  right  And now  you've got to wrap it up and tie it up here. You've got to give me the final  you know    boom     the final pitch that's going to send me into space. Now  in the process of doing this over here  how do you remember the sequences and doers  You've noticed here that I'm not looking at the screen  right  The screen is  actually  in this room  is set up so it's in front of me. So  I couldn't even see if I wanted to. So now  how do I know what's going on here  Well  I've got a laptop in front of me  but you're looking at me. And you're looking at this. What do you think I'm looking at  You think that I'm looking at that  No  I'm looking actually at a special version of PowerPoint over here  which shows me the slides ahead  the slides behind  my notes from here  so I can see what's going on. PowerPoint has this built into every copy of PowerPoint that's shipped. If you use Apple's Keynote  it's got an even better version in Keynote. And then there's another program  called Ovation  you can get from Adobe  that they just bought last summer. Which actually helps you run the whole timers  and it lets you figure out what's going on. So  here's my wrap up to take you to the moon  right  David's    I usually do a top     we don't have time for top   s. So David's top five presentation tips. Number one  always use presenter mode  or Ovation  or presenter tools  because it lets you know exactly where you're going. It helps you pace yourself  it gives you a timer so we end on time and the whole bit. Number four  always use remote control. Have you seen me touch the computer  No  you haven't. Why not  Because I'm using remote control over here. Always use remote control. Number three  the handouts you give are not your presentation. If you follow my suggestions  you're going to have a very spare  very Zen like presentation  which is great for conveying who you are and getting people emotionally involved. But it's not really good as a handout. You want to have a handout that gives a lot more information  because the handout has to stand without you over here. Number three  don't read your speech. Can you imagine   Well  you should invest in my company because it's really good.  It doesn't work  right  Don't read your speech. And the number one presentation tip  never  ever look at the screen. You're making a connection with your audience over here  and you always want to do a one on one connection. The screen should come up visually behind you  and supplement what you're doing instead of replace you. And that is how to pitch to a VC. If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard  and you say   Well  what about thinking and emotions   Most people will say   Emotions are terribly hard. They're incredibly complex. They can't    I have no idea of how they work. But thinking is really very straightforward  it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning  or something. But that's not the hard part.  So here's a list of problems that come up. One nice problem is  what do we do about health  The other day  I was reading something  and the person said probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the West. And there was a little study about people who don't handshake  and comparing them with ones who do handshake. And I haven't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don't handshake  because they must be hiding. And the people who avoid that have    percent less infectious disease or something. Or maybe it was    and a quarter percent. So if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth  let's start with that. And since I got that idea  I've had to shake hundreds of hands. And I think the only way to avoid it is to have some horrible visible disease  and then you don't have to explain. Education  how do we improve education  Well  the single best way is to get them to understand that what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense. And then  of course  you have to do something about how to moderate that  so that anybody can    so they'll listen to you. Pollution  energy shortage  environmental diversity  poverty. How do we make stable societies  Longevity. Okay  there're lots of problems to worry about. Anyway  the question I think people should talk about    and it's absolutely taboo    is  how many people should there be  And I think it should be about     million or maybe     million. And then notice that a great many of these problems disappear. If you had     million people properly spread out  then if there's some garbage  you throw it away  preferably where you can't see it  and it will rot. Or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it. The problem is  how many people should there be  And it's a sort of choice we have to make. Most people are about    inches high or more  and there's these cube laws. So if you make them this big  by using nanotechnology  I suppose       then you could have a thousand times as many. That would solve the problem  but I don't see anybody doing any research on making people smaller. Now  it's nice to reduce the population  but a lot of people want to have children. And there's one solution that's probably only a few years off. You know you have    chromosomes. If you're lucky  you've got    from each parent. Sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out  but    so you can skip the grandparent and great grandparent stage and go right to the great great grandparent. And you have    people and you give them a scanner  or whatever you need  and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says which one he likes best  or she    no reason to have just two sexes any more  even. So each child has    parents  and I suppose you could let each group of    parents have    children. Wouldn't that be enough  And then the children would get plenty of support  and nurturing  and mentoring  and the world population would decline very rapidly and everybody would be totally happy. Timesharing is a little further off in the future. And there's this great novel that Arthur Clarke wrote twice  called  Against the Fall of Night  and  The City and the Stars.  They're both wonderful and largely the same  except that computers happened in between. And Arthur was looking at this old book  and he said   Well  that was wrong. The future must have some computers.  So in the second version of it  there are     billion or       billion people on Earth  but they're all stored on hard disks or floppies  or whatever they have in the future. And you let a few million of them out at a time. A person comes out  they live for a thousand years doing whatever they do  and then  when it's time to go back for a billion years    or a million  I forget  the numbers don't matter    but there really aren't very many people on Earth at a time. And you get to think about yourself and your memories  and before you go back into suspension  you edit your memories and you change your personality and so forth. The plot of the book is that there's not enough diversity  so that the people who designed the city make sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created. And in the novel  a particular one named Alvin is created. And he says  maybe this isn't the best way  and wrecks the whole system. I don't think the solutions that I proposed are good enough or smart enough. I think the big problem is that we're not smart enough to understand which of the problems we're facing are good enough. Therefore  we have to build super intelligent machines like HAL. As you remember  at some point in the book for         HAL realizes that the universe is too big  and grand  and profound for those really stupid astronauts. If you contrast HAL's behavior with the triviality of the people on the spaceship  you can see what's written between the lines. Well  what are we going to do about that  We could get smarter. I think that we're pretty smart  as compared to chimpanzees  but we're not smart enough to deal with the colossal problems that we face  either in abstract mathematics or in figuring out economies  or balancing the world around. So one thing we can do is live longer. And nobody knows how hard that is  but we'll probably find out in a few years. You see  there's two forks in the road. We know that people live twice as long as chimpanzees almost  and nobody lives more than     years  for reasons that aren't very well understood. But lots of people now live to    or      unless they shake hands too much or something like that. And so maybe if we lived     years  we could accumulate enough skills and knowledge to solve some problems. So that's one way of going about it. And as I said  we don't know how hard that is. It might be    after all  most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee  so we're sort of three and a half or four times  have four times the longevity of most mammals. And in the case of the primates  we have almost the same genes. We only differ from chimpanzees  in the present state of knowledge  which is absolute hogwash  maybe by just a few hundred genes. What I think is that the gene counters don't know what they're doing yet. And whatever you do  don't read anything about genetics that's published within your lifetime  or something. The stuff has a very short half life  same with brain science. And so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes  we can live     years. Or it might be that it's just    or     and I doubt that it's several hundred. So this is something that people will be discussing and lots of ethicists    you know  an ethicist is somebody who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind. And it's very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change worth making  because he says  what about the consequences  And  of course  we're not responsible for the consequences of what we're doing now  are we  Like all this complaint about clones. And yet two random people will mate and have this child  and both of them have some pretty rotten genes  and the child is likely to come out to be average. Which  by chimpanzee standards  is very good indeed. If we do have longevity  then we'll have to face the population growth problem anyway. Because if people live     or       years  then we can't let them have a child more than about once every     or       years. And so there won't be any workforce. And one of the things Laurie Garrett pointed out  and others have  is that a society that doesn't have people of working age is in real trouble. And things are going to get worse  because there's nobody to educate the children or to feed the old. And when I'm talking about a long lifetime  of course  I don't want somebody who's     years old to be like our image of what a     year old is    which is dead  actually. You know  there's about     different parts of the brain which seem to have different functions. Nobody knows how most of them work in detail  but we do know that there're lots of different things in there. And they don't always work together. I like Freud's theory that most of them are cancelling each other out. And so if you think of yourself as a sort of city with a hundred resources  then  when you're afraid  for example  you may discard your long range goals  but you may think deeply and focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal. You throw everything else away. You become a monomaniac    all you care about is not stepping out on that platform. And when you're hungry  food becomes more attractive  and so forth. So I see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability. Emotion is not something added to thought. An emotional state is what you get when you remove     or     of your normally available resources. So thinking of emotions as the opposite of    as something less than thinking is immensely productive. And I hope  in the next few years  to show that this will lead to smart machines. And I guess I better skip all the rest of this  which are some details on how we might make those smart machines and       and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you. This is a problem of such and such a type  and therefore there's a certain way or ways of thinking that are good for that problem. So I think the future  main problem of psychology is to classify types of predicaments  types of situations  types of obstacles and also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up. So you see  it's almost like a Pavlovian    we lost the first hundred years of psychology by really trivial theories  where you say  how do people learn how to react to a situation  What I'm saying is  after we go through a lot of levels  including designing a huge  messy system with thousands of ports  we'll end up again with the central problem of psychology. Saying  not what are the situations  but what are the kinds of problems and what are the kinds of strategies  how do you learn them  how do you connect them up  how does a really creative person invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth. So  I think in the next    years  if we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence  like neural nets and genetic algorithms and rule based systems  and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say  can we make a system that can use all those things for the right kind of problem  Some problems are good for neural nets  we know that others  neural nets are hopeless on them. Genetic algorithms are great for certain things  I suspect I know what they're bad at  and I won't tell you. Thank you. Philosophers  dramatists  theologians have grappled with this question for centuries  what makes people go wrong  Interestingly  I asked this question when I was a little kid. I grew up in the South Bronx  inner city ghetto in New York  and I was surrounded by evil  as all kids are who grew up in an inner city. And I had friends who were really good kids  who lived out the Dr. Jekyll Mr. Hyde scenario    Robert Louis Stevenson. That is  they took drugs  got in trouble  went to jail. Some got killed  and some did it without drug assistance. So when I read Robert Louis Stevenson  that wasn't fiction. The only question is  what was in the juice  And more importantly  that line between good and evil    which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable  with them on the good side  the others on the bad side    I knew that line was movable  and it was permeable. Good people could be seduced across that line  and under good and some rare circumstances  bad kids could recover with help  with reform  with rehabilitation. So I want to begin with this wonderful illusion by  Dutch  artist M.C. Escher. If you look at it and focus on the white  what you see is a world full of angels. But let's look more deeply  and as we do  what appears is the demons  the devils in the world. That tells us several things. One  the world is  was  will always be filled with good and evil  because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition. It tells me something else. If you remember  God's favorite angel was Lucifer. Apparently  Lucifer means  the light.  It also means  the morning star   in some scripture. And apparently  he disobeyed God  and that's the ultimate disobedience to authority. And when he did  Michael  the archangel  was sent to kick him out of heaven along with the other fallen angels. And so Lucifer descends into hell  becomes Satan  becomes the devil  and the force of evil in the universe begins. Paradoxically  it was God who created hell as a place to store evil. He didn't do a good job of keeping it there though. So  this arc of the cosmic transformation of God's favorite angel into the Devil  for me  sets the context for understanding human beings who are transformed from good  ordinary people into perpetrators of evil. So the Lucifer effect  although it focuses on the negatives    the negatives that people can become  not the negatives that people are    leads me to a psychological definition. Evil is the exercise of power. And that's the key  it's about power. To intentionally harm people psychologically  to hurt people physically  to destroy people mortally  or ideas  and to commit crimes against humanity. If you Google  evil   a word that should surely have withered by now  you come up with     million hits in a third of a second. A few years ago    I am sure all of you were shocked  as I was  with the revelation of American soldiers abusing prisoners in a strange place in a controversial war  Abu Ghraib in Iraq. And these were men and women who were putting prisoners through unbelievable humiliation. I was shocked  but I wasn't surprised  because I had seen those same visual parallels when I was the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study. Immediately the Bush administration military said what  What all administrations say when there's a scandal   Don't blame us. It's not the system. It's the few bad apples  the few rogue soldiers.  My hypothesis is  American soldiers are good  usually. Maybe it was the barrel that was bad. But how am I going to deal with that hypothesis  I became an expert witness for one of the guards  Sergeant Chip Frederick  and in that position  I had access to the dozen investigative reports. I had access to him. I could study him  have him come to my home  get to know him  do psychological analysis to see  was he a good apple or bad apple. And thirdly  I had access to all of the       pictures that these soldiers took. These pictures are of a violent or sexual nature. All of them come from the cameras of American soldiers. Because everybody has a digital camera or cell phone camera  they took pictures of everything  more than      . And what I've done is I organized them into various categories. But these are by United States military police  army reservists. They are not soldiers prepared for this mission at all. And it all happened in a single place  Tier   A  on the night shift. Why  Tier   A was the center for military intelligence. It was the interrogation hold. The CIA was there. Interrogators from Titan Corporation  all there  and they're getting no information about the insurgency. So they're going to put pressure on these soldiers  military police  to cross the line  give them permission to break the will of the enemy  to prepare them for interrogation  to soften them up  to take the gloves off. Those are the euphemisms  and this is how it was interpreted. Let's go down to that dungeon.  Abu Ghraib Iraq Prison Abuses      Military Police Guards' Photos   The following images include nudity and graphic depictions of violence  So  pretty horrific. That's one of the visual illustrations of evil. And it should not have escaped you that the reason I paired the prisoner with his arms out with Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity is that that prisoner was mentally ill. That prisoner covered himself with shit every day  they had to roll him in dirt so he wouldn't stink. But the guards ended up calling him  Shit Boy.  What was he doing in that prison rather than in some mental institution  In any event  here's former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld. He comes down and says   I want to know  who is responsible  Who are the bad apples   Well  that's a bad question. You have to reframe it and ask   What is responsible    What  could be the who of people  but it could also be the what of the situation  and obviously that's wrongheaded. How do psychologists try to understand such transformations of human character  if you believe that they were good soldiers before they went down to that dungeon  There are three ways. The main way is called dispositional. We look at what's inside of the person  the bad apples. This is the foundation of all of social science  the foundation of religion  the foundation of war. Social psychologists like me come along and say   Yeah  people are the actors on the stage  but you'll have to be aware of the situation. Who are the cast of characters  What's the costume  Is there a stage director   And so we're interested in what are the external factors around the individual    the bad barrel  Social scientists stop there and they miss the big point that I discovered when I became an expert witness for Abu Ghraib. The power is in the system. The system creates the situation that corrupts the individuals  and the system is the legal  political  economic  cultural background. And this is where the power is of the bad barrel makers. If you want to change a person  change the situation. And to change it  you've got to know where the power is  in the system. So the Lucifer effect involves understanding human character transformations with these three factors. And it's a dynamic interplay. What do the people bring into the situation  What does the situation bring out of them  And what is the system that creates and maintains that situation  My recent book   The Lucifer Effect   is about  how do you understand how good people turn evil  And it has a lot of detail about what I'm going to talk about today. So Dr. Z's  Lucifer Effect   although it focuses on evil  really is a celebration of the human mind's infinite capacity to make any of us kind or cruel  caring or indifferent  creative or destructive  and it makes some of us villains. And the good news that I'm going to hopefully come to at the end is that it makes some of us heroes. This wonderful cartoon in the New Yorker summarizes my whole talk   I'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop  Jerome. Like yourself  I'm a complex amalgam of positive and negative personality traits that emerge or not  depending on the circumstances.  There's a study some of you think you know about  but very few people have ever read the story. You watched the movie. This is Stanley Milgram  little Jewish kid from the Bronx  and he asked the question   Could the Holocaust happen here  now   People say   No  that's Nazi Germany  Hitler  you know  that's     .  He said   Yeah  but suppose Hitler asked you  'Would you electrocute a stranger ' 'No way  I'm a good person.'  He said   Why don't we put you in a situation and give you a chance to see what you would do   And so what he did was he tested       ordinary people.     New Haven  Connecticut      Bridgeport. And the ad said   Psychologists want to understand memory. We want to improve people's memory  because it is the key to success.  OK   We're going to give you five bucks    four dollars for your time. We don't want college students. We want men between    and   .  In the later studies  they ran women. Ordinary people  barbers  clerks  white collar people. So  you go down  one of you will be a learner  one will be a teacher. The learner's a genial  middle aged guy. He gets tied up to the shock apparatus in another room. The learner could be middle aged  could be as young as   . And one of you is told by the authority  the guy in the lab coat   Your job as teacher is to give him material to learn. Gets it right  reward. Gets it wrong  you press a button on the shock box. The first button is    volts. He doesn't even feel it.  That's the key. All evil starts with    volts. And then the next step is another    volts. The problem is  at the end of the line  it's     volts. And as you go along  the guy is screaming   I've got a heart condition  I'm out of here   You're a good person. You complain.  Sir  who will be responsible if something happens to him   The experimenter says   Don't worry  I will be responsible. Continue  teacher.  And the question is  who would go all the way to     volts  You should notice here  when it gets up to      it says   Danger. Severe Shock.  When it gets up to here  there's  XXX     the pornography of power. So Milgram asks    psychiatrists   What percent of American citizens would go to the end   They said only one percent. Because that's sadistic behavior  and we know  psychiatry knows  only one percent of Americans are sadistic. OK. Here's the data. They could not be more wrong. Two thirds go all the way to     volts. This was just one study. Milgram did more than    studies. And look at this. In study     where you see somebody like you go all the way     percent go all the way. In study five  if you see people rebel     percent rebel. What about women  Study       no different than men. So Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people to blindly obey authority  to go all the way to     volts. And it's like a dial on human nature. A dial in a sense that you can make almost everybody totally obedient  down to the majority  down to none. What are the external parallels  For all research is artificial. What's the validity in the real world      American citizens committed suicide or were murdered by family and friends in Guyana jungle in       because they were blindly obedient to this guy  their pastor    not their priest    their pastor  Reverend Jim Jones. He persuaded them to commit mass suicide. And so  he's the modern Lucifer effect  a man of God who becomes the Angel of Death. Milgram's study is all about individual authority to control people. Most of the time  we are in institutions  so the Stanford Prison Study is a study of the power of institutions to influence individual behavior. Interestingly  Stanley Milgram and I were in the same high school class in James Monroe in the Bronx      . I did this study with my graduate students  especially Craig Haney    and it also began work with an ad. We had a cheap  little ad  but we wanted college students for a study of prison life.    people volunteered  took personality tests. We did interviews. Picked two dozen  the most normal  the most healthy. Randomly assigned them to be prisoner and guard. So on day one  we knew we had good apples. I'm going to put them in a bad situation. And secondly  we know there's no difference between the boys who will be guards and those who will be prisoners. To the prisoners  we said   Wait at home. The study will begin Sunday.  We didn't tell them that the city police were going to come and do realistic arrests.  Day    Student  A police car pulls up in front  and a cop comes to the front door  and knocks  and says he's looking for me. So they  right there  you know  they took me out the door  they put my hands against the car. It was a real cop car  it was a real policeman  and there were real neighbors in the street  who didn't know that this was an experiment. And there was cameras all around and neighbors all around. They put me in the car  then they drove me around Palo Alto. They took me to the basement of the police station. Then they put me in a cell. I was the first one to be picked up  so they put me in a cell  which was just like a room with a door with bars on it. You could tell it wasn't a real jail. They locked me in there  in this degrading little outfit. They were taking this experiment too seriously. Here are the prisoners  who are going to be dehumanized  they'll become numbers. Here are the guards with the symbols of power and anonymity. Guards get prisoners to clean the toilet bowls out with their bare hands  to do other humiliating tasks. They strip them naked. They sexually taunt them. They begin to do degrading activities  like having them simulate sodomy. You saw simulating fellatio in soldiers in Abu Ghraib. My guards did it in five days. The stress reaction was so extreme that normal kids we picked because they were healthy had breakdowns within    hours. The study ended after six days  because it was out of control. Five kids had emotional breakdowns. Does it make a difference if warriors go to battle changing their appearance or not  If they're anonymous  how do they treat their victims  In some cultures  they go to war without changing their appearance. In others  they paint themselves like  Lord of the Flies.  In some  they wear masks. In many  soldiers are anonymous in uniform. So this anthropologist  John Watson  found    cultures that had two bits of data. Do they change their appearance    . Do they kill  torture  mutilate    . If they don't change their appearance  only one of eight kills  tortures or mutilates. The key is in the red zone. If they change their appearance     of       that's    percent    kill  torture  mutilate. And that's the power of anonymity. So what are the seven social processes that grease the slippery slope of evil  Mindlessly taking the first small step. Dehumanization of others. De individuation of self. Diffusion of personal responsibility. Blind obedience to authority. Uncritical conformity to group norms. Passive tolerance of evil through inaction  or indifference. And it happens when you're in a new or unfamiliar situation. Your habitual response patterns don't work. Your personality and morality are disengaged.  Nothing is easier than to denounce the evildoer  nothing more difficult than understanding him   Dostoyevsky. Understanding is not excusing. Psychology is not excuse ology. So social and psychological research reveals how ordinary  good people can be transformed without the drugs. You don't need it. You just need the social psychological processes. Real world parallels  Compare this with this. James Schlesinger    I'm going to end with this    says   Psychologists have attempted to understand how and why individuals and groups who usually act humanely can sometimes act otherwise in certain circumstances.  That's the Lucifer effect. And he goes on to say   The landmark Stanford study provides a cautionary tale for all military operations.  If you give people power without oversight  it's a prescription for abuse. They knew that  and let that happen. So another report  an investigative report by General Fay  says the system is guilty. In this report  he says it was the environment that created Abu Ghraib  by leadership failures that contributed to the occurrence of such abuse  and because it remained undiscovered by higher authorities for a long period of time. Those abuses went on for three months. Who was watching the store  The answer is nobody  I think on purpose. He gave the guards permission to do those things  and they knew nobody was ever going to come down to that dungeon. So you need a paradigm shift in all of these areas. The shift is away from the medical model that focuses only on the individual. The shift is toward a public health model that recognizes situational and systemic vectors of disease. Bullying is a disease. Prejudice is a disease. Violence is a disease. Since the Inquisition  we've been dealing with problems at the individual level. It doesn't work. Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn says   The line between good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being.  That means that line is not out there. That's a decision that you have to make  a personal thing. So I want to end very quickly on a positive note. Heroism as the antidote to evil  by promoting the heroic imagination  especially in our kids  in our educational system. We want kids to think   I'm a hero in waiting  waiting for the right situation to come along  and I will act heroically. My whole life  I'm now going to focus away from evil    that I've been in since I was a kid    to understanding heroes. Banality of heroism. It's ordinary people who do heroic deeds. It's the counterpoint to Hannah Arendt's  Banality of Evil.  Our traditional societal heroes are wrong  because they are the exceptions. They organize their life around this. That's why we know their names. Our kids' heroes are also wrong models for them  because they have supernatural talents. We want our kids to realize most heroes are everyday people  and the heroic act is unusual. This is Joe Darby. He was the one that stopped those abuses you saw  because when he saw those images  he turned them over to a senior investigating officer. He was a low level private  and that stopped it. Was he a hero  No. They had to put him in hiding  because people wanted to kill him  and then his mother and his wife. For three years  they were in hiding. This is the woman who stopped the Stanford Prison Study. When I said it got out of control  I was the prison superintendent. I didn't know it was out of control. I was totally indifferent. She saw that madhouse and said   You know what  it's terrible what you're doing to those boys. They're not prisoners nor guards  they're boys  and you are responsible.  And I ended the study the next day. The good news is I married her the next year. I just came to my senses  obviously. So situations have the power to do  three things . But the point is  this is the same situation that can inflame the hostile imagination in some of us  that makes us perpetrators of evil  can inspire the heroic imagination in others. It's the same situation and you're on one side or the other. Most people are guilty of the evil of inaction  because your mother said   Don't get involved. Mind your own business.  And you have to say   Mama  humanity is my business.  So the psychology of heroism is    we're going to end in a moment    how do we encourage children in new hero courses  that I'm working on with Matt Langdon    he has a hero workshop    to develop this heroic imagination  this self labeling   I am a hero in waiting   and teach them skills. To be a hero  you have to learn to be a deviant  because you're always going against the conformity of the group. Heroes are ordinary people whose social actions are extraordinary. Who act. The key to heroism is two things. You have to act when other people are passive. B  You have to act socio centrically  not egocentrically. And I want to end with a known story about Wesley Autrey  New York subway hero. Fifty year old African American construction worker standing on a subway. A white guy falls on the tracks. The subway train is coming. There's    people there. You know what  They freeze. He's got a reason not to get involved. He's black  the guy's white  and he's got two kids. Instead  he gives his kids to a stranger  jumps on the tracks  puts the guy between the tracks  lays on him  the subway goes over him. Wesley and the guy       and a half inches height. The train clearance is    inches. A half an inch would have taken his head off. And he said   I did what anyone could do   no big deal to jump on the tracks. And the moral imperative is  I did what everyone should do.  And so one day  you will be in a new situation. Take path one  you're going to be a perpetrator of evil. Evil  meaning you're going to be Arthur Andersen. You're going to cheat  or you're going to allow bullying. Path two  you become guilty of the evil of passive inaction. Path three  you become a hero. The point is  are we ready to take the path to celebrating ordinary heroes  waiting for the right situation to come along to put heroic imagination into action  Because it may only happen once in your life  and when you pass it by  you'll always know  I could have been a hero and I let it pass me by. So the point is thinking it and then doing it. So I want to thank you. Thank you. Let's oppose the power of evil systems at home and abroad  and let's focus on the positive. Advocate for respect of personal dignity  for justice and peace  which sadly our administration has not been doing. Thanks so much. Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of praise  admiration and thank you  and having it be specific and genuine. And the way I got interested in this was  I noticed in myself  when I was growing up  and until about a few years ago  that I would want to say thank you to someone  I would want to praise them  I would want to take in their praise of me and I'd just stop it. And I asked myself  why  I felt shy  I felt embarrassed. And then my question became  am I the only one who does this  So  I decided to investigate. I'm fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility  so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction. And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as  their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them. But then  they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him  but he never told the son. It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it. So my question is  why don't we ask for the things that we need  I know a gentleman  married for    years  who's longing to hear his wife say   Thank you for being the breadwinner  so I can stay home with the kids   but won't ask. I know a woman who's good at this. She  once a week  meets with her husband and says   I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids.  And he goes   Oh  this is great  this is great.  And praise really does have to be genuine  but she takes responsibility for that. And a friend of mine  April  who I've had since kindergarten  she thanks her children for doing their chores. And she said   Why wouldn't I thank it  even though they're supposed to do it   So  the question is  why was I blocking it  Why were other people blocking it  Why can I say   I'll take my steak medium rare  I need size six shoes   but I won't say   Would you praise me this way   And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me. I'm telling you where I'm insecure. I'm telling you where I need your help. And I'm treating you  my inner circle  like you're the enemy. Because what can you do with that data  You could neglect me. You could abuse it. Or you could actually meet my need. And I took my bike into the bike store   I love this    same bike  and they'd do something called  truing  the wheels. The guy said   You know  when you true the wheels  it's going to make the bike so much better.  I get the same bike back  and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I've had for two and a half years  and my bike is like new. So  I'm going to challenge all of you. I want you to true your wheels  be honest about the praise that you need to hear. What do you need to hear  Go home to your wife    go ask her  what does she need  Go home to your husband    what does he need  Go home and ask those questions  and then help the people around you. And it's simple. And why should we care about this  We talk about world peace. How can we have world peace with different cultures  different languages  I think it starts household by household  under the same roof. So  let's make it right in our own backyard. And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands  great mothers  friends  daughters  sons. And maybe somebody's never said that to you  but you've done a really  really good job. And thank you for being here  just showing up and changing the world with your ideas. Thank you. I'm a  or was  or kind of am a toy designer. And before I was a toy designer  oh  I was a mime  a street mime  actually. And then I was an entertainer  I guess. And before that  I was a silversmith  and before that  I was    I was out of the house at about    and a half  and I never wound up going into college. I didn't really    I didn't see the point at the time. I do now  after learning about all the quantum stuff. It's really cool. Anyway  I wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design  at least from my small aperture of the world. This is a video I made when I first started doing toy design. I'm in my garage  making weird stuff. And then you go to these toy companies and there's some guy across the table  and he goes   Pass. Pass. Pass.  You know  you think it's so cool  but they    anyway  I made this little tape that I'd always show when I go in. This is the name of my company  Giving Toys. So I used to work at Mattel  actually. And after I left Mattel  I started all these hamburger makers  and then got the license to make the maker. So this is a hamburger maker that you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there  and it makes    and this is a French fry maker  little  tiny food you can eat. I beat up the pasta maker to make that. Then this is a McNugget maker  I think. This  now that's the McNugget maker  and this is a    this is my oldest daughter making a McApple Pie. And let's see  you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar  and then you eat  and you eat  and you eat  and you    she's about     pounds now. No  she's not  she's beautiful. This is how they looked when they came out at the end. These are a    this is like a    million dollar line. And it got me through some    I didn't make any royalties on this  but it got me through. Next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff. That was a missile foam launcher that didn't get sold. This is a squishy head  for no apparent reason. This is some effects that I did for  Wig  Rattle and Roll.  That was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back. That paid the rent for about a month. This is a walking Barbie    I said   Oh  this is it   And they go   Oh  that's really nice   and out it goes. So this is some fighting robots. I thought everyone would want these. They fight  they get back up  you know  Wouldn't this be cool  And they made it into a toy  and then they dropped it like a hot rock. They're pretty cool. This is a   we're doing some flight testing on my little pug  seeing if this can really grab. It does pretty good. I'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin. It's how they  see  have those album things    kids don't know what they are. This is a clay maker. You know  I said    I went to Play Doh  and said   Look  I can animate this.  They said   Don't talk to us about Play Doh.  And then  I made a Lego animator. I thought  this would be so great  And you know  Lego    don't take Legos to Lego. That's the answer. They know everything about it. Then I started doing animatronics. I loved dinosaurs. I used to be in the film business  kind of  and actually  Nicholas Negroponte saw this when I was  like      and anyway  so then they said   No  you have to make two and they have to fight.  You know  how    why would a kid want a dinosaur  This is me using  unclear  or   D Studio  back in the '  s. That's David Letterman. You can see how old this stuff is. That's my youngest cousin. This is a segment called   Dangerous Toys You Won't See at Christmas.  We had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair. My career basically peaked here. And in the back are foam core cutouts of the people who couldn't make it to the show. This is MEK going through a windshield wiper motor. So this is a    I used to kind of be an actor. And I'm really not very good at it. But the    this is a guy named Dr. Yatz  who would take toys apart and show kids about engineering. And you can see the massively parallel processing Nintendos there. And over to the left is a view master of the CD ROM. And a guy named Stan Reznikov did this as a pilot. This is a    you can see the little window there. You can actually see the Steadicam with a bubble on the bottom. You see the keyboard strapped to my wrist. Way ahead of my time here. Narrator  I love toys  Caleb Chung  That's all I wanted to say there. I love toys. OK  so  so that was a  that was the first kind of a    that was the first batch of products. Most of them did not go. You get one out of     one out of    products. And every now and then  we do something like a  you know  an automated hair wrap machine  you know  that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out  and    and we'd make some money on that  you know. And we'd give it out. But eventually  we left L.A.  and we moved to Idaho  where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet. And I started working on this project    oh  I have to tell you about this real quick. Throughout this whole thing  making toys  I think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science. There's some kind of a blend that happens that allows  you know  to find innovation. And I tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol that means something  to me anyway. And so  art and science have a kind of dynamic balance  that's where I think innovation happens. And actually  this is  to me  how I can come up with great ideas. But it's not how you actually get leverage. Actually  you have to put a circle around that  and call it business. And those three together  I think  give you leverage in the world. But moving on. So  this is a quick tale I'm going to tell. This is the Furby tale. As he said  I was co inventor of the Furby. I did the body and creature    well  you'll see. So by way of showing you this  you can kind of get an understanding of what it is to  hopefully  try to create robotic life forms  or technology that has an emotional connection with the user. So this is my family. This is my wife  Christi  and Abby  and Melissa  and my    year old now  Emily  who was just a pack of trouble. All right  there's that robot again. I came out of the movie business  as I said  and I said  let's make these animatronic robots. Let's make these things. And so I've always had a big interest in this. This one actually didn't go anywhere  but I got my feet wet doing this. This is a smaller one  and I have a little moving torso on there. A little  tiny guy walks along. More servo drives  lots of servo hacking  lots of mechanical stuff. There's another one. He actually has skeletor legs  I think  he's wearing there. Oh  this is a little pony  little pony    very cute little thing. The point of showing these is I've always been interested in little artificial life pieces. So the challenge was    I worked for Microsoft for a little bit  working on the Microsoft Barney. And this is a    you know  the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear. And  you know  they had lots  just lots of stuff in there that you didn't need  I thought. And then Microsoft can just fill a  you know  a warehouse full of this stuff and see if they sell. So it's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company. But anyway  a friend of mine and I  Dave Hampton  decided to see if we could do like a single cell organism. What's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form  And that's our little  thirty cent Mabuchi motor. And so  I have all these design books  like I'm sure many of you have. And throughout the books    this is the first page on Furby    I have kind of the art and science. I have the why over here  and the how over there. I try to do a lot of philosophy  a lot of thinking about all of these projects. Because they're not just  bing  ideas  you have to really dig deep in these things. So there's some real pseudo code over here  and getting the idea of different kind of drives  things like that. And originally  Furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom. And then we said  well  you're going to feed him  and he needs to talk  and it got more complicated. And then I had to figure out how I'm going to use that one motor to make the eyes move  and the ears move  and the body to move  and the mouth to move. And  you know  I want to make it blink and do all that at the same time. Well  I came up with this kind of linear expression thing with these cams and feedback. And that worked pretty well. Then I started to get a little more realistic and I have to start drawing the stuff. And there's my  note to self  at the top   lots of engineering.  So that turned out to be a little more than true. There's my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff. And then I've got to start building it  so this is the real thing. I get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together. And that's my little workshop. And there's the first little cam that drove Furby. And there's Furby on the half shell. You can see the little BB in the box is my tilt sensor. I just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic. So there's the back of his head with a billion holes in it. And there I am. I'm done. There's my little Furby. No  it's a little robot on heroin or something  I think. So right now  you see  I love little robots. So my wife says   Well  you may like it  but nobody else will.  So she comes to the rescue. This is my wife Christi  who is just  you know  my muse and my partner for eternity here. And she does drawings  right  She's an actual  you know  artist. And she starts doing all these different drawings and does color patterns and coloring books. And I like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there. He didn't test so well  but I like him. And then she started doing these other images. At that time  Beanie Babies was a big hit  and we thought  we'll do a bunch of different ones. So here's a little pink one  a little pouf on his head. And here's    this didn't do so well in testing either  I don't know why. There's my favorite  Demon Furby. That was a good one. Anyway  finally settled on kind of this kind of a look  little poufy body  a little imaginary character. And there he is  a little bush baby on    caught in the headlights there. I actually went to Toys R Us  got a little furry cat  ripped it apart and made this. And since then  every time I come home from Toys R Us with dolls or something  they disappear from my desk and they get hidden in the house. I have three girls and they just  they    it's like a rescue animal thing they're going there. So  a little tether coming off  it's just a control for the Fur's mouth and his eyes. It's just a little server control and I made a little video going   Hi  my name's Furby  and I'm good   you know  and then I'd reach my hand. He'd    you can tickle him. When I put my hand up   Ha  ha  ha  ha  and that's how we sold him. And Hasbro actually said  I meant Tiger Electronics at the time  said   Yeah  we want to do this. We have  you know     weeks or something to Toy Fair  and we're going to hire you guys to do this.  And so Dave and I got working. Mostly me  because it was all mechanics at this point. So now I have to really figure out all kinds of stuff I don't know how to do. And I started working with Solid Works and a whole other group to do that. And we started    this was way back before there was really much SLA going on  not a lot of rapid prototyping. We certainly didn't have the money to do this. They only paid me  like  a little bit of money to do this  so I had to call a friend of a friend who was running the GM prototype plant  SLA plant  that was down. And they said   Yeah  well  we'll run them.  So they ran all the shells for us  which was nice of them. And the cams I got cut at Hewlett Packard. We snuck in on the weekend. And so we just had a disc of the files. But they have a closed system  so you couldn't print the things out on the machine. So we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors. And on the weekend we ran the parts for that. So this is how they come out close to the end. And then they looked like little Garfields there. Eight months later    you may remember this  this was a    total  total  total chaos. For a while  they were making two million Furbys a month. They actually wound up doing about    million Furbys. I    it's unbelievable how    I don't know how that can be. And Hasbro made about  you know  a billion and a half dollars. And I just a little bit on each one. So full circle    why do I do this  Why do you  you know  try to do this stuff  And it's  of course  for your kids. And there's my youngest daughter with her Furbys. And she still actually has those. So I kind of retired  and we're already living in paradise up in Boise  on a river  you know. So and then I started another company called Toy Innovation and we did some projects with Mattel with actually with a lady who's here  Ivy Ross  and we did Miracle Moves Baby  made it in Wired magazine  did a bunch of other stuff. And then I started another company. We did a little hand held device for teens that could hook up to the Internet  won  Best Innovations  at CES  but really I kind of slowed down and said  OK  I just ... After a while  I had this old tape of this dinosaur  and I gave it to this guy  and this other guy saw it  and then people started to want to do it. And they said they'd spend all this time. So I said   OK  let's try to do this dinosaur project.  The crazy idea is we're going to try to clone a dinosaur as much as we can with today's technology. And it's not really    but as close as we can do. And we're going to try to really pull this off  intentfully try to make something that seems like it's alive. Not a robot that kind of does  but let's really go for it. So I picked a Camarasaurus  because the Camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in North America. And you could actually find full fossil evidence of these. That's a juvenile. And so we actually went in. There's a book called  Walking on Eggshells   where they found actual sauropod skin in Patagonia. And the picture from the book  so when I    I told the sculptor to use this bump pattern  whatever you can to copy that. Very  very obsessive. There's a kind of truncated Camarasaurus skeleton  but the geometry's correct. And then I went in  and measured all the geometry because I figured  hey  biomimicry. If I do it kind of right  it might move kind of like the real thing. So there's the motor. And about this time  you know  all these other people are starting to help. Here's an example of what we did with the skull. There's the skull  there's my drawing of a skull. There's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue. There's the mechanism that would go in there  kind of a Geneva drive. There's some Solid Works versions of it. Here's some SLA parts of the same thing. And then  these are really crude pieces. We were just doing some tests here. There's the skull  pretty much the same shape as the Camarasaurus. There's a photorealistic eye behind a lens. And there's kind of the first exploded view  or see through view. There's the first SLA version  and it already kind of has the feel  it has kind of a cuteness already. And the thing about blending science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot  and then you go back and do the shape  and then you go back and forth. The servos in the front legs  we had to shape those like muscles. They had to fit within the envelope. There was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right. All the neck and the tail are cable  so it moves smoothly and organically. And then  of course  you're not done yet. You have to get the look for the skin. The skin's a whole another thing  probably the hardest part. So you hire artists  and you try to get the look and feel of the character. Now  this is not    we're character designers  right  And we're still trying to keep with the real character. So  now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay. Now you start doing the sculpture for this. And you can see we got a guy from    who's just a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us  down to the spoon shaped teeth and everything. And then more sculpting  and then more sculpting  and then more sculpting  and then more sculpting. And then  four years and    million dollars later  we have a little Pleo. John  do you want to bring him up  John Sosoka is our CTO  and is really the man that's done most of the work with our    person company. I'd like to give John a hand. He never gets recognition. This is John Sosoka. So  thank you  John  thank you  and get back to work  all right  man  All right       no  it's very painful  so       these are little Pleos and you can probably see them. This    I on purpose    they go through life stages. So when you first get them  they're babies. And you    more you have them  kind of the older they get  and they kind of learn through their behavior. So this one  this one's actually asleep  and    hang on. Pleo  wake up. Pleo  come on. So this guy's listening to my voice here. But they have    sensors all over their body. They have seven processors  they have    motors  they have    but you don't care  do you  They're just cute  right  That's the idea  that's the idea. So you see    hey  come on. Hey  did you feel that  There's something big and loud over here. Hey. That's good  wake up  wake up  wake up. Yeah  they're like kids  you know. You  yeah  yeah. Okay  he's hungry. I'll show you what he's been doing for  for four years. Here  here  here. Have some money  Pleo. There you go. That's what the investors think  that it's just       right  right. So they're really sweet little guys. And we're hoping that    you know  our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things in order to be more human. And we think we can help that out by having little creatures that you can love. Now these are not robots  they're kind of lovebots  you know. They do change over time. But mostly they evoke a feeling of caring. And we have a    I have a little something here. Now I do want to say that  you know  Ugobe is not there yet. We've just opened the door  and it's for all of you to step through it. We did include some things that are hopefully useful. Excuse me  Pleo. They    he has a USB and he has a SD card  so it's completely open architecture. So anyone can plug him     Applause     thank you. This is John over here. Anyone can take Pleo and they can totally redo his personality. You can make him bipolar  or as someone said  a    you can change his homeostatic drives  or whatever you want to call them. Kids can just drag and drop  put in new sounds. We    actually  it's very hard to keep people from doing this. We have one animator who's taken it and he's done a take on the Budweiser beer commercial  and they're going   Whassup   you know  You    so it's    yes  he likes that. So they're a handful. We hope you get one. I don't know what I'm missing to say  but as a last thing  I'd like to say is that if we continue along this path  we are designing our children's best friends. And there's a lot of social responsibility in that. That's why Pleo's soft and gentle and loving. And so I just    I hope we all dream well. Thank you. A year ago  I spoke to you about a book that I was just in the process of completing  that has come out in the interim  and I would like to talk to you today about some of the controversies that that book inspired. The book is called  The Blank Slate   based on the popular idea that the human mind is a blank slate  and that all of its structure comes from socialization  culture  parenting  experience. The  blank slate  was an influential idea in the   th century. Here are a few quotes indicating that   Man has no nature   from the historian Jose Ortega y Gasset   Man has no instincts   from the anthropologist Ashley Montagu   The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to none   from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould. There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind is a blank slate  and some of them just come from common sense. As many people have told me over the years  anyone who's had more than one child knows that kids come into the world with certain temperaments and talents  it doesn't all come from the outside. Oh  and anyone who has both a child and a house pet has surely noticed that the child  exposed to speech  will acquire a human language  whereas the house pet won't  presumably because of some innate different between them. And anyone who's ever been in a heterosexual relationship knows that the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable. There are also  I think  increasing results from the scientific study of humans that  indeed  we're not born blank slates. One of them  from anthropology  is the study of human universals. If you've ever taken anthropology  you know that it's a    kind of an occupational pleasure of anthropologists to show how exotic other cultures can be  and that there are places out there where  supposedly  everything is the opposite to the way it is here. But if you instead look at what is common to the world's cultures  you find that there is an enormously rich set of behaviors and emotions and ways of construing the world that can be found in all of the world's       odd cultures. The anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all  and they range from aesthetics  affection and age statuses all the way down to weaning  weapons  weather  attempts to control  the color white and a worldview. Also  genetics and neuroscience are increasingly showing that the brain is intricately structured. This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson and his colleagues in which they    using MRI    measured the distribution of gray matter    that is  the outer layer of the cortex    in a large sample of pairs of people. They coded correlations in the thickness of gray matter in different parts of the brain using a false color scheme  in which no difference is coded as purple  and any color other than purple indicates a statistically significant correlation. Well  this is what happens when you pair people up at random. By definition  two people picked at random can't have correlations in the distribution of gray matter in the cortex. This is what happens in people who share half of their DNA    fraternal twins. And as you can see  large amounts of the brain are not purple  showing that if one person has a thicker bit of cortex in that region  so does his fraternal twin. And here's what happens if you get a pair of people who share all their DNA    namely  clones or identical twins. And you can see huge areas of cortex where there are massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter. Now  these aren't just differences in anatomy  like the shape of your ear lobes  but they have consequences in thought and behavior that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams   Separated at birth  the Mallifert twins meet accidentally.  As you can see  there are two inventors with identical contraptions in their lap  meeting in the waiting room of a patent attorney. Now  the cartoon is not such an exaggeration  because studies of identical twins who were separated at birth and then tested in adulthood show that they have astonishing similarities. And this happens in every pair of identical twins separated at birth ever studied    but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth. My favorite example is a pair of twins  one of whom was brought up as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany  the other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad. When they walked into the lab in Minnesota  they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes  both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee  both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists  both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after  and both of them liked to surprise people by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump. Now    the story might seem to good to be true  but when you administer batteries of psychological tests  you get the same results    namely  identical twins separated at birth show quite astonishing similarities. Now  given both the common sense and scientific data calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question  why should it have been such an appealing notion  Well  there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial. The foremost is that if we're blank slates  then  by definition  we are equal  because zero equals zero equals zero. But if something is written on the slate  then some people could have more of it than others  and according to this line of thinking  that would justify discrimination and inequality. Another political fear of human nature is that if we are blank slates  we can perfect mankind    the age old dream of the perfectibility of our species through social engineering. Whereas  if we're born with certain instincts  then perhaps some of them might condemn us to selfishness  prejudice and violence. Well  in the book  I argue that these are  in fact  non sequiturs. And just to make a long story short  first of all  the concept of fairness is not the same as the concept of sameness. And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote in the Declaration of Independence   We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are created equal   he did not mean  We hold these truths to be self evident  that all men are clones.  Rather  that all men are equal in terms of their rights  and that every person ought to be treated as an individual  and not prejudged by the statistics of particular groups that they may belong to. Also  even if we were born with certain ignoble motives  they don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior. That is because the human mind is a complex system with many parts  and some of them can inhibit others. For example  there's excellent reason to believe that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense  and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us to profit from the lessons of history. So even if people did have impulses towards selfishness or greed  that's not the only thing in the skull  and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them. In the book  I go over controversies such as this one  and a number of other hot buttons  hot zones  Chernobyls  third rails  and so on    including the arts  cloning  crime  free will  education  evolution  gender differences  God  homosexuality  infanticide  inequality  Marxism  morality  Nazism  parenting  politics  race  rape  religion  resource depletion  social engineering  technological risk and war. And needless to say  there were certain risks in taking on these subjects. When I wrote a first draft of the book  I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments  and here are some of the reactions that I got   Better get a security camera for your house.   Don't expect to get any more awards  job offers or positions in scholarly societies.   Tell your publisher not to list your hometown in your author bio.   Do you have tenure   Well  the book came out in October  and nothing terrible has happened. I    I like    There was indeed reason to be nervous  and there were moments in which I did feel nervous  knowing the history of what has happened to people who've taken controversial stands or discovered disquieting findings in the behavioral sciences. There are many cases  some of which I talk about in the book  of people who have been slandered  called Nazis  physically assaulted  threatened with criminal prosecution for stumbling across or arguing about controversial findings. And you never know when you're going to come across one of these booby traps. My favorite example is a pair of psychologists who did research on left handers  and published some data showing that left handers are  on average  more susceptible to disease  more prone to accidents and have a shorter lifespan. It's not clear  by the way  since then  whether that is an accurate generalization  but the data at the time seemed to support that. Well  pretty soon they were barraged with enraged letters  death threats  ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals  coming from irate left handers and their advocates  and they were literally afraid to open their mail because of the venom and vituperation that they had inadvertently inspired. Well  the night is young  but the book has been out for half a year  and nothing terrible has happened. None of the dire professional consequences has taken place    I haven't been exiled from the city of Cambridge. But what I wanted to talk about are two of these hot buttons that have aroused the strongest response in the    odd reviews that The Blank Slate has received. I'll just put that list up for a few seconds  and see if you can guess which two    I would estimate that probably two of these topics inspired probably    percent of the reaction in the various reviews and radio interviews. It's not violence and war  it's not race  it's not gender  it's not Marxism  it's not Nazism. They are  the arts and parenting. So let me tell you what aroused such irate responses  and I'll let you decide if whether they    the claims are really that outrageous. Let me start with the arts. I note that among the long list of human universals that I presented a few slides ago are art. There is no society ever discovered in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something that we would consider the arts. Visual arts    decoration of surfaces and bodies    appears to be a human universal. The telling of stories  music  dance  poetry    found in all cultures  and many of the motifs and themes that give us pleasure in the arts can be found in all human societies  a preference for symmetrical forms  the use of repetition and variation  even things as specific as the fact that in poetry all over the world  you have lines that are very close to three seconds long  separated by pauses. Now  on the other hand  in the second half of the   th century  the arts are frequently said to be in decline. And I have a collection  probably    or    headlines  from highbrow magazines deploring the fact that the arts are in decline in our time. I'll give you a couple of representative quotes   We can assert with some confidence that our own period is one of decline  that the standards of culture are lower than they were    years ago  and that the evidences of this decline are visible in every department of human activity.  That's a quote from T. S. Eliot  a little more than    years ago. And a more recent one   The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time is becoming increasing problematical. Serious book stores are losing their franchise  nonprofit theaters are surviving primarily by commercializing their repertory  symphony orchestras are diluting their programs  public television is increasing its dependence on reruns of British sitcoms  classical radio stations are dwindling  museums are resorting to blockbuster shows  dance is dying.  That's from Robert Brustein  the famous drama critic and director  in The New Republic about five years ago. Well  in fact  the arts are not in decline. I don't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room  but by any standard they have never been flourishing to a greater extent. There are  of course  entirely new art forms and new media  many of which you've heard over these few days. By any economic standard  the demand for art of all forms is skyrocketing  as you can tell from the price of opera tickets  by the number of books sold  by the number of books published  the number of musical titles released  the number of new albums and so on. The only grain of truth to this complaint that the arts are in decline come from three spheres. One of them is in elite art since the     s    say  the kinds of works performed by major symphony orchestras  where most of the repertory is before       or the works shown in major galleries and prestigious museums. In literary criticism and analysis  probably    or    years ago  literary critics were a kind of cultural hero  now they're kind of a national joke. And the humanities and arts programs in the universities  which by many measures  indeed are in decline. Students are staying away in droves  universities are disinvesting in the arts and humanities. Well  here's a diagnosis. They didn't ask me  but by their own admission  they need all the help that they can get. And I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence that this supposed decline in the elite arts and criticism occurred in the same point in history in which there was a widespread denial of human nature. A famous quotation can be found    if you look on the web  you can find it in literally scores of English core syllabuses     In or about December       human nature changed.  A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf  and there's some debate as to what she actually meant by that. But it's very clear  looking at these syllabuses  that    it's used now as a way of saying that all forms of appreciation of art that were in place for centuries  or millennia  in the   th century were discarded. The beauty and pleasure in art    probably a human universal    were    began to be considered saccharine  or kitsch  or commercial. Barnett Newman had a famous quote that  the impulse of modern art is the desire to destroy beauty     which was considered bourgeois or tacky. And here's just one example. I mean  this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the   th century  here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the   th century. And  as you can see  there    something has changed in the way the elite arts appeal to the senses. Indeed  in movements of modernism and post modernism  there was visual art without beauty  literature without narrative and plot  poetry without meter and rhyme  architecture and planning without ornament  human scale  green space and natural light  music without melody and rhythm  and criticism without clarity  attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition. Let me give just you an example to back up that last statement. But here  there    one of the most famous literary English scholars of our time is the Berkeley professor  Judith Butler. And here is an example of one of her analyses   The move from a structuralist account in which capital is understood to structure social relations in relatively homologous ways to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition  convergence and rearticulation brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure  and marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ...  Well  you get the idea. By the way  this is one sentence    you can actually parse it. Well  the argument in  The Blank Slate  was that elite art and criticism in the   th century  although not the arts in general  have disdained beauty  pleasure  clarity  insight and style. People are staying away from elite art and criticism. What a puzzle    I wonder why. Well  this turned out to be probably the most controversial claim in the book. Someone asked me whether I stuck it in in order to deflect ire from discussions of gender and Nazism and race and so on. I won't comment on that. But it certainly inspired an energetic reaction from many university professors. Well  the other hot button is parenting. And the starting point is the    for that discussion was the fact that we have all been subject to the advice of the parenting industrial complex. Now  here is    here is a representative quote from a besieged mother   I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice. I'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit so they'll grow up to be healthy adults. And I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play so they'll grow up smart. And there are all kinds of play    clay for finger dexterity  word games for reading success  large motor play  small motor play. I feel like I could devote my life to figuring out what to play with my kids.  I think anyone who's recently been a parent can sympathize with this mother. Well  here's some sobering facts about parenting. Most studies of parenting on which this advice is based are useless. They're useless because they don't control for heritability. They measure some correlation between what the parents do  how the children turn out and assume a causal relation  that the parenting shaped the child. Parents who talk a lot to their kids have kids who grow up to be articulate  parents who spank their kids have kids who grow up to be violent and so on. And very few of them control for the possibility that parents pass on genes for    that increase the chances a child will be articulate or violent and so on. Until the studies are redone with adoptive children  who provide an environment but not genes to their kids  we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid. The genetically controlled studies have some sobering results. Remember the Mallifert twins  separated at birth  then they meet in the patent office    remarkably similar. Well  what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together  You might think  well  then they'd be even more similar  because not only would they share their genes  but they would also share their environment. That would make them super similar  right  Wrong. Identical twins  or any siblings  who are separated at birth are no less similar than if they had grown up together. Everything that happens to you in a given home over all of those years appears to leave no permanent stamp on your personality or intellect. A complementary finding  from a completely different methodology  is that adopted siblings reared together    the mirror image of identical twins reared apart  they share their parents  their home  their neighborhood  don't share their genes    end up not similar at all. OK    two different bodies of research with a similar finding. What it suggests is that children are shaped not by their parents over the long run  but in part    only in part    by their genes  in part by their culture    the culture of the country at large and the children's own culture  namely their peer group    as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today  that's what kids care about    and  to a very large extent  larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge  by chance  chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero  chance events as you live your life. So let me conclude with just a remark to bring it back to the theme of choices. I think that the sciences of human nature    behavioral genetics  evolutionary psychology  neuroscience  cognitive science    are going to  increasingly in the years to come  upset various dogmas  careers and deeply held political belief systems. And that presents us with a choice. The choice is whether certain facts about humans  or topics  are to be considered taboos  forbidden knowledge  where we shouldn't go there because no good can come from it  or whether we should explore them honestly. I have my own answer to that question  which comes from a great artist of the   th century  Anton Chekhov  who said   Man will become better when you show him what he is like.  And I think that the argument can't be put any more eloquently than that. Thank you very much. What I want to tell you about today is how I see robots invading our lives at multiple levels  over multiple timescales. And when I look out in the future  I can't imagine a world      years from now  where we don't have robots everywhere. Assuming    despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future    assuming we're still around  I can't imagine the world not being populated with robots. And then the question is  well  if they're going to be here in     years  are they going to be everywhere sooner than that  Are they going to be around in    years  Yeah  I think that's pretty likely    there's going to be lots of robots everywhere. And in fact I think that's going to be a lot sooner than that. I think we're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common  and I think we're sort of around      or      in personal computer years  where the first few robots are starting to appear. Computers sort of came around through games and toys. And you know  the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play Pong  a little microprocessor embedded  and then other games that came after that. And we're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots  LEGO Mindstorms  Furbies    who here    did anyone here have a Furby  Yeah  there's    million of them sold worldwide. They are pretty common. And they're a little tiny robot  a simple robot with some sensors  a little bit of processing actuation. On the right there is another robot doll  who you could get a couple of years ago. And just as in the early days  when there was a lot of sort of amateur interaction over computers  you can now get various hacking kits  how to hack books. And on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics  where you put a PC on  and you program this thing with a GUI to wander around your house and do various stuff. And then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys    the Sony Aibo. And on the right there  is one that the NEC developed  the PaPeRo  which I don't think they're going to release. But nevertheless  those sorts of things are out there. And we've seen  over the last two or three years  lawn mowing robots  Husqvarna on the bottom  Friendly Robotics on top there  an Israeli company. And then in the last    months or so we've started to see a bunch of home cleaning robots appear. The top left one is a very nice home cleaning robot from a company called Dyson  in the U.K. Except it was so expensive          dollars    they didn't release it. But at the bottom left  you see Electrolux  which is on sale. Another one from Karcher. At the bottom right is one that I built in my lab about    years ago  and we finally turned that into a product. And let me just show you that. We're going to give this away I think  Chris said  after the talk. This is a robot that you can go out and buy  and that will clean up your floor. And it starts off sort of just going around in ever increasing circles. If it hits something    you people see that  Now it's doing wall following  it's following around my feet to clean up around me. Let's see  let's    oh  who stole my Rice Krispies  They stole my Rice Krispies  Don't worry  relax  no  relax  it's a robot  it's smart  See  the three year old kids  they don't worry about it. It's grown ups that get really upset. We'll just put some crap here. Okay. I don't know if you see    so  I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there  I put some pennies  let's just shoot it at that  see if it cleans up. Yeah  OK. So    we'll leave that for later. Part of the trick was building a better cleaning mechanism  actually  the intelligence on board was fairly simple. And that's true with a lot of robots. We've all  I think  become  sort of computational chauvinists  and think that computation is everything  but the mechanics still matter. Here's another robot  the PackBot  that we've been building for a bunch of years. It's a military surveillance robot  to go in ahead of troops    looking at caves  for instance. But we had to make it fairly robust  much more robust than the robots we build in our labs. On board that robot is a PC running Linux. It can withstand a    G shock. The robot has local intelligence  it can flip itself over  can get itself into communication range  can go upstairs by itself  et cetera. Okay  so it's doing local navigation there. A soldier gives it a command to go upstairs  and it does. That was not a controlled descent. Now it's going to head off. And the big breakthrough for these robots  really  was September   th. We had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening. Couldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile  things were just too    there was nothing left to do. But we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated  and searched for possible survivors in the buildings that were too dangerous to go into. Let's run this video. Reporter  ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks. Nick Robertson has that story. Rodney Brooks  Can we have another one of these  Okay  good. So  this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously. He's sending robots into caves  looking at what's going on. The robot's being totally autonomous. The worst thing that's happened in the cave so far was one of the robots fell down ten meters. So one year ago  the US military didn't have these robots. Now they're on active duty in Afghanistan every day. And that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening. There's a sea change happening in how    where technology's going. Thanks. And over the next couple of months  we're going to be sending robots in production down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground. Very hostile environments       C         PSI. Autonomous robots going down  doing this sort of work. But robots like this  they're a little hard to program. How  in the future  are we going to program our robots and make them easier to use  And I want to actually use a robot here    a robot named Chris    stand up. Yeah. Okay. Come over here. Now notice  he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff. He sort of does that. But I'm going to    Chris Anderson  I'm just British. RB  Oh. I'm going to show this robot a task. It's a very complex task. Now notice  he nodded there  he was giving me some indication he was understanding the flow of communication. And if I'd said something completely bizarre he would have looked askance at me  and regulated the conversation. So now I brought this up in front of him. I'd looked at his eyes  and I saw his eyes looked at this bottle top. And I'm doing this task here  and he's checking up. His eyes are going back and forth up to me  to see what I'm looking at    so we've got shared attention. And so I do this task  and he looks  and he looks to me to see what's happening next. And now I'll give him the bottle  and we'll see if he can do the task. Can you do that  Okay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good  good  good. I didn't show you how to do that. Now see if you can put it back together. And he thinks a robot has to be really slow. Good robot  that's good. So we saw a bunch of things there. We saw when we're interacting  we're trying to show someone how to do something  we direct their visual attention. The other thing communicates their internal state to us  whether he's understanding or not  regulates a social interaction. There was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing  and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end. And we've been trying to put that into our lab robots because we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future. I just want to show you one technical diagram here. The most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially is its visual attention system. Because what it pays attention to is what it's seeing and interacting with  and what you're understanding what it's doing. So in the videos I'm about to show you  you're going to see a visual attention system on a robot which has    it looks for skin tone in HSV space  so it works across all human colorings. It looks for highly saturated colors  from toys. And it looks for things that move around. And it weights those together into an attention window  and it looks for the highest scoring place    the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening    and that is what its eyes then segue to. And it looks right at that. At the same time  some top down sort of stuff  might decide that it's lonely and look for skin tone  or might decide that it's bored and look for a toy to play with. And so these weights change. And over here on the right  this is what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module. Did people see the movie  AI    Audience  Yes.  RB  Yeah  it was really bad  but    remember  especially when Haley Joel Osment  the little robot  looked at the blue fairy for       years without taking his eyes off it  Well  this gets rid of that  because this is a habituation Gaussian that gets negative  and more and more intense as it looks at one thing. And it gets bored  so it will then look away at something else. So  once you've got that    and here's a robot  here's Kismet  looking around for a toy. You can tell what it's looking at. You can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera  and you can tell when it's actually seeing the toy. And it's got a little bit of an emotional response here. But it's still going to pay attention if something more significant comes into its field of view    such as Cynthia Breazeal  the builder of this robot  from the right. It sees her  pays attention to her. Kismet has an underlying  three dimensional emotional space  a vector space  of where it is emotionally. And at different places in that space  it expresses    can we have the volume on here  Can you hear that now  out there   Audience  Yeah.  Kismet  Do you really think so  Do you really think so  Do you really think so  RB  So it's expressing its emotion through its face and the prosody in its voice. And when I was dealing with my robot over here  Chris  the robot  was measuring the prosody in my voice  and so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages that mothers give their children pre linguistically. Here we've got naive subjects praising the robot  Voice  Nice robot. You're such a cute little robot. RB  And the robot's reacting appropriately. Voice  ...very good  Kismet. Voice  Look at my smile. RB  It smiles. She imitates the smile. This happens a lot. These are naive subjects. Here we asked them to get the robot's attention and indicate when they have the robot's attention. Voice  Hey  Kismet  ah  there it is. RB  So she realizes she has the robot's attention. Voice  Kismet  do you like the toy  Oh. RB  Now  here they're asked to prohibit the robot  and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner. Voice  No. No. You're not to do that. No. Not appropriate. No. No. RB  I'm going to leave it at that. We put that together. Then we put in turn taking. When we talk to someone  we talk. Then we sort of raise our eyebrows  move our eyes  give the other person the idea it's their turn to talk. And then they talk  and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other. So we put this in the robot. We got a bunch of naive subjects in  we didn't tell them anything about the robot  sat them down in front of the robot and said  talk to the robot. Now what they didn't know was  the robot wasn't understanding a word they said  and that the robot wasn't speaking English. It was just saying random English phonemes. And I want you to watch carefully  at the beginning of this  where this person  Ritchie  who happened to talk to the robot for    minutes       says   I want to show you something. I want to show you my watch.  And he brings the watch center  into the robot's field of vision  points to it  gives it a motion cue  and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully. We don't know whether he understood or not that the robot    Notice the turn taking. Ritchie  OK  I want to show you something. OK  this is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. Robot  Oh  cool. Ritchie  Yeah  look  it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week. RB  So it's making eye contact with him  following his eyes. Ritchie  Can you do the same thing  Robot  Yeah  sure. RB  And they successfully have that sort of communication. And here's another aspect of the sorts of things that Chris and I were doing. This is another robot  Cog. They first make eye contact  and then  when Christie looks over at this toy  the robot estimates her gaze direction and looks at the same thing that she's looking at. So we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot over the next few years in labs. But then the big questions  two big questions that people ask me are  if we make these robots more and more human like  will we accept them  will we    will they need rights eventually  And the other question people ask me is  will they want to take over  And on the first    you know  this has been a very Hollywood theme with lots of movies. You probably recognize these characters here    where in each of these cases  the robots want more respect. Well  do you ever need to give robots respect  They're just machines  after all. But I think  you know  we have to accept that we are just machines. After all  that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us. You don't see a description of how  you know  Molecule A  you know  comes up and docks with this other molecule. And it's moving forward  you know  propelled by various charges  and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect. It's all mechanistic. We are mechanism. If we are machines  then in principle at least  we should be able to build machines out of other stuff  which are just as alive as we are. But I think for us to admit that  we have to give up on our special ness  in a certain way. And we've had the retreat from special ness under the barrage of science and technology many times over the last few hundred years  at least.     years ago we had to give up the idea that we are the center of the universe when the earth started to go around the sun      years ago  with Darwin  we had to give up the idea we were different from animals. And to imagine    you know  it's always hard for us. Recently we've been battered with the idea that maybe we didn't even have our own creation event  here on earth  which people didn't like much. And then the human genome said  maybe we only have        genes. And that was really    people didn't like that  we've got more genes than that. We don't like to give up our special ness  so  you know  having the idea that robots could really have emotions  or that robots could be living creatures    I think is going to be hard for us to accept. But we're going to come to accept it over the next    years or so. And the second question is  will the machines want to take over  And here the standard scenario is that we create these things  they grow  we nurture them  they learn a lot from us  and then they start to decide that we're pretty boring  slow. They want to take over from us. And for those of you that have teenagers  you know what that's like. But Hollywood extends it to the robots. And the question is  you know  will someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us  And that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard  you know     I accidentally built a    .  I don't think that's going to happen. And I don't think       I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots that we're uncomfortable with. We'll    you know  they're not going to have a super bad robot. Before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot  and before that a not so bad robot. And we're just not going to let it go that way. So  I think I'm going to leave it at that  the robots are coming  we don't have too much to worry about  it's going to be a lot of fun  and I hope you all enjoy the journey over the next    years. I was here about four years ago  talking about the relationship of design and happiness. At the very end of it  I showed a list under that title. I learned very few things in addition since but made a whole number of them into projects since. These are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland   Everybody always thinks they are right.  They were combined in the media.  Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on.  We're doing changing media. This is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by. You can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart. All of these things are pieces of graphic design. We do them for our clients. They are commissioned. I would never have the money to actually pay for the installment or pay for all the billboards or the production of these  so there's always a client attached to them. These are        coat hangers in a street that's lined with fashion stores.  Worrying solves nothing.   Money does not make me happy  appeared first as double page spreads in a magazine. The printer lost the file  didn't tell us. When the magazine    actually  when I got the subscription    it was    following pages. It said   Money does does make me happy.  And a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest casino owner in Linz into letting us wrap his building. So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz. It just says  Money   and if you look down the side street  it says   does not make me happy.  We had a show that just came down last week in New York. We steamed up the windows permanently  and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window. Everybody participated    Milton Glaser  Massimo Vignelli. Singapore was quite in discussion. This is a little spot that we filmed there that's to be displayed on the large JumboTrons in Singapore. And  of course  it's one that's dear to my heart  because all of these sentiments    some banal  some a bit more profound    all originally had come out of my diary. And I do go often into the diary and check if I wanted to change something about the situation. If it's    see it for a long enough time  I actually do something about it. And the very last one is a billboard. This is our roof in New York  the roof of the studio. This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint. We let that lie around in the sun. As you all know  newsprint yellows significantly in the sun. After a week  we took the stencils and the leaves off  shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot  so on day one the billboard said   Complaining is silly. Either act or forget.  Three days later it faded  and a week later  no more complaining anywhere. Thank you so much.
