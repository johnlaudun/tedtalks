I'm not sure that every person here is familiar with my pictures. I want to start to show just a few pictures to you  and after I'll speak. I must speak to you a little bit of my history  because we'll be speaking on this during my speech here. I was born in      in Brazil  in the times that Brazil was not yet a market economy. I was born on a farm  a farm that was more than    percent rainforest  still . A marvelous place. I lived with incredible birds  incredible animals  I swam in our small rivers with our caimans. It was about    families that lived on this farm  and everything that we produced on this farm  we consumed. Very few things went to the market. Once a year  the only thing that went to the market was the cattle that we produced  and we made trips of about    days to reach the slaughterhouse  bringing thousands of head of cattle  and about    days traveling back to reach our farm again. When I was    years old  it was necessary for me to leave this place and go to a town a little bit bigger    much bigger    where I did the second part of secondary school. There I learned different things. Brazil was starting to urbanize  industrialize  and I knew the politics. I became a little bit radical  I was a member of leftist parties  and I became an activist. I  went to  university to become an economist. I  did  a master's degree in economics. And the most important thing in my life also happened in this time. I met an incredible girl who became my lifelong best friend  and my associate in everything that I have done till now  my wife  L lia Wanick Salgado. Brazil radicalized very strongly. We fought very hard against the dictatorship  in a moment it was necessary to us  Either go into clandestinity with weapons in hand  or leave Brazil. We were too young  and our organization thought it was better for us to go out  and we went to France  where I did a PhD in economics  L ila became an architect. I worked after for an investment bank. We made a lot of trips  financed development  economic projects in Africa with the World Bank. And one day photography made a total invasion in my life. I became a photographer  abandoned everything and became a photographer  and I started to do the photography that was important for me. Many people tell me that you are a photojournalist  that you are an anthropologist photographer  that you are an activist photographer. But I did much more than that. I put photography as my life. I lived totally inside photography doing long term projects  and I want to show you just a few pictures of    again  you'll see inside the social projects  that I went to  I published many books on these photographs  but I'll just show you a few ones now. In the '  s  from      to       I photographed a story called Migrations. It became a book. It became a show. But during the time that I was photographing this  I lived through a very hard moment in my life  mostly in Rwanda. I saw in Rwanda total brutality. I saw deaths by thousands per day. I lost my faith in our species. I didn't believe that it was possible for us to live any longer  and I started to be attacked by my own Staphylococcus. I started to have infection everywhere. When I made love with my wife  I had no sperm that came out of me  I had blood. I went to see a friend's doctor in Paris  told him that I was completely sick. He made a long examination  and told me   Sebastian  you are not sick  your prostate is perfect. What happened is  you saw so many deaths that you are dying. You must stop. Stop. You must stop because on the contrary  you will be dead.  And I made the decision to stop. I was really upset with photography  with everything in the world  and I made the decision to go back to where I was born. It was a big coincidence. It was the moment that my parents became very old. I have seven sisters. I'm one of the only men in my family  and they made together the decision to transfer this land to L ila and myself. When we received this land  this land was as dead as I was. When I was a kid  it was more than    percent rainforest. When we received the land  it was less than half a percent rainforest  as in all my region. To build development  Brazilian development  we destroyed a lot of our forest. As you did here in the United States  or you did in India  everywhere in this planet. To build our development  we come to a huge contradiction that we destroy around us everything. This farm that had thousands of head of cattle had just a few hundreds  and we didn't know how to deal with these. And L ila came up with an incredible idea  a crazy idea. She said  why don't you put back the rainforest that was here before  You say that you were born in paradise. Let's build the paradise again. And I went to see a good friend that was engineering forests to prepare a project for us  and we started. We started to plant  and this first year we lost a lot of trees  second year less  and slowly  slowly this dead land started to be born again. We started to plant hundreds of thousands of trees  only local species  only native species  where we built an ecosystem identical to the one that was destroyed  and the life started to come back in an incredible way. It was necessary for us to transform our land into a national park. We transformed. We gave this land back to nature. It became a national park. We created an institution called Instituto Terra  and we built a big environmental project to raise money everywhere. Here in Los Angeles  in the Bay Area in San Francisco  it became tax deductible in the United States. We raised money in Spain  in Italy  a lot in Brazil. We worked with a lot of companies in Brazil that put money into this project  the government. And the life started to come  and I had a big wish to come back to photography  to photograph again. And this time  my wish was not to photograph anymore just one animal that I had photographed all my life  us. I wished to photograph the other animals  to photograph the landscapes  to photograph us  but us from the beginning  the time we lived in equilibrium with nature. And I went. I started in the beginning of       and I finished at the end of     . We created an incredible amount of pictures  and the result    L lia did the design of all my books  the design of all my shows. She is the creator of the shows. And what we want with these pictures is to create a discussion about what we have that is pristine on the planet and what we must hold on this planet if we want to live  to have some equilibrium in our life. And I wanted to see us when we used  yes  our instruments in stone. We exist yet. I was last week at the Brazilian National Indian Foundation  and only in the Amazon we have about     groups of Indians that are not contacted yet. We must protect the forest in this sense. And with these pictures  I hope that we can create information  a system of information. We tried to do a new presentation of the planet  and I want to show you now just a few pictures of this project  please. Well  this    Applause    Thank you. Thank you very much. This is what we must fight hard to hold like it is now. But there is another part that we must together rebuild  to build our societies  our modern family of societies  we are at a point where we cannot go back. But we create an incredible contradiction. To build all this  we destroy a lot. Our forest in Brazil  that antique forest that was the size of California  is destroyed today    percent. Here  on the West Coast  you've destroyed your forest. Around here  no  The redwood forests are gone. Gone very fast  disappeared. Coming the other day from Atlanta  here  two days ago  I was flying over deserts that we made  we provoked with our own hands. India has no more trees. Spain has no more trees. And we must rebuild these forests. That is the essence of our life  these forests. We need to breathe. The only factory capable to transform CO  into oxygen  are the forests. The only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are producing  always  even if we reduce them  everything that we do  we produce CO   are the trees. I put the question    three or four weeks ago  we saw in the newspapers millions of fish that die in Norway. A lack of oxygen in the water. I put to myself the question  if for a moment  we will not lack oxygen for all animal species  ours included    that would be very complicated for us. For the water system  the trees are essential. I'll give you a small example that you'll understand very easily. You happy people that have a lot of hair on your head  if you take a shower  it takes you two or three hours to dry your hair if you don't use a dryer machine. Me  one minute  it's dry. The same with the trees. The trees are the hair of our planet. When you have rain in a place that has no trees  in just a few minutes  the water arrives in the stream  brings soil  destroying our water source  destroying the rivers  and no humidity to retain. When you have trees  the root system holds the water. All the branches of the trees  the leaves that come down create a humid area  and they take months and months under the water  go to the rivers  and maintain our source  maintain our rivers. This is the most important thing  when we imagine that we need water for every activity in life. I want to show you now  to finish  just a few pictures that for me are very important in that direction. You remember that I told you  when I received the farm from my parents that was my paradise  that was the farm. Land completely destroyed  the erosion there  the land had dried. But you can see in this picture  we were starting to construct an educational center that became quite a large environmental center in Brazil. But you see a lot of small spots in this picture. In each point of those spots  we had planted a tree. There are thousands of trees. Now I'll show you the pictures made exactly in the same point two months ago. I told you in the beginning that it was necessary for us to plant about  .  million trees of about     different species in order to rebuild the ecosystem. And I'll show you the last picture. We are with two million trees in the ground now. We are doing the sequestration of about         tons of carbon with these trees. My friends  it's very easy to do. We did it  no  By an accident that happened to me  we went back  we built an ecosystem. We here inside the room  I believe that we have the same concern  and the model that we created in Brazil  we can transplant it here. We can apply it everywhere around the world  no  And I believe that we can do it together. Thank you very much. All right  so let's take four subjects that obviously go together  big data  tattoos  immortality and the Greeks. Right  Now  the issue about tattoos is that  without a word  tattoos really do shout.  Beautiful   Intriguing  So you don't have to say a lot.  Allegiance   Very intimate   Serious mistakes  And tattoos tell you a lot of stories. If I can ask an indiscreet question  how many of you have tattoos  A few  but not most. What happens if Facebook  Google  Twitter  LinkedIn  cell phones  GPS  Foursquare  Yelp  Travel Advisor  all these things you deal with every day turn out to be electronic tattoos  And what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would  What's ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are Tweeting  blogging  following you  watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself. And electronic tattoos also shout. And as you're thinking of the consequences of that  it's getting really hard to hide from this stuff  among other things  because it's not just the electronic tattoos  it's facial recognition that's getting really good. So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names  although  again  sometimes it does make mistakes.  Laughter  But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this  take a picture  say  of this guy right here  get the name  and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody  because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos. And so there's companies like face.com that now have about    billion faces online. Here's what happened to this company.  Company sold to Facebook  June         ...  There are other companies that will place a camera like this   this has nothing to do with Facebook   they take your picture  they tie it to the social media  they figure out you really like to wear black dresses  so maybe the person in the store comes up and says   Hey  we've got five black dresses that would just look great on you.  So what if Andy was wrong  Here's Andy's theory.  In the future  everybody will be world famous for    minutes.  What if we flip this  What if you're only going to be anonymous for    minutes   Laughter  Well  then  because of electronic tattoos  maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality  because these tattoos will live far longer than our bodies will. And if that's true  then what we want to do is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks and one lesson from a Latin American. Why the Greeks  Well  the Greeks thought about what happens when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time. So lesson number one  Sisyphus. Remember  He did a horrible thing  condemned for all time to roll this rock up  it would roll back down  roll back up  roll back down. It's a little like your reputation. Once you get that electronic tattoo  you're going to be rolling up and down for a long time  so as you go through this stuff  just be careful what you post. Myth number two  Orpheus  wonderful guy  charming to be around  great partier  great singer  loses his beloved  charms his way into the underworld  only person to charm his way into the underworld  charms the gods of the underworld  they release his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they're out. So he's walking out and walking out and walking out and he just can't resist. He looks at her  loses her forever. With all this data out here  it might be a good idea not to look too far into the past of those you love. Lesson number three  Atalanta. Greatest runner. She would challenge anybody. If you won  she would marry you. If you lost  you died. How did Hippomenes beat her  Well  he had all these wonderful little golden apples  and she'd run ahead  and he'd roll a little golden apple. She'd run ahead  and he'd roll a little golden apple. She kept getting distracted. He eventually won the race. Just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples come and reach you and you want to post about them or tweet about them or send a late night message. And then  of course  there's Narcissus. Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus. But as you're thinking about Narcissus  just don't fall in love with your own reflection. Last lesson  from a Latin American  This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges. When he was threatened by the thugs of the Argentine military junta  he came back and said   Oh  come on  how else can you threaten  other than with death   The interesting thing  the original thing  would be to threaten somebody with immortality. And that  of course  is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos. Thank you. I have spent my entire life either at the schoolhouse  on the way to the schoolhouse  or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse. Both my parents were educators  my maternal grandparents were educators  and for the past    years  I've done the same thing. And so  needless to say  over those years I've had a chance to look at education reform from a lot of perspectives. Some of those reforms have been good. Some of them have been not so good. And we know why kids drop out. We know why kids don't learn. It's either poverty  low attendance  negative peer influences... We know why. But one of the things that we never discuss or we rarely discuss is the value and importance of human connection. Relationships. James Comer says that no significant learning can occur without a significant relationship. George Washington Carver says all learning is understanding relationships. Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult. For years  I have watched people teach. I have looked at the best and I've looked at some of the worst. A colleague said to me one time   They don't pay me to like the kids. They pay me to teach a lesson. The kids should learn it. I should teach it  they should learn it  Case closed.  Well  I said to her   You know  kids don't learn from people they don't like.  She said   That's just a bunch of hooey.  And I said to her   Well  your year is going to be long and arduous  dear.  Needless to say  it was. Some people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship  or you don't. I think Stephen Covey had the right idea. He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things  like seeking first to understand  as opposed to being understood. Simple things  like apologizing. You ever thought about that  Tell a kid you're sorry  they're in shock. I taught a lesson once on ratios. I'm not real good with math  but I was working on it. And I got back and looked at that teacher edition. I'd taught the whole lesson wrong. So I came back to class the next day and I said   Look  guys  I need to apologize. I taught the whole lesson wrong. I'm so sorry.  They said   That's okay  Ms. Pierson. You were so excited  we just let you go.  I have had classes that were so low  so academically deficient  that I cried. I wondered   How am I going to take this group  in nine months  from where they are to where they need to be  And it was difficult  it was awfully hard. How do I raise the self esteem of a child and his academic achievement at the same time  One year I came up with a bright idea. I told all my students   You were chosen to be in my class because I am the best teacher and you are the best students  they put us all together so we could show everybody else how to do it.  One of the students said   Really   I said   Really. We have to show the other classes how to do it  so when we walk down the hall  people will notice us  so you can't make noise. You just have to strut.  And I gave them a saying to say   I am somebody. I was somebody when I came. I'll be a better somebody when I leave. I am powerful  and I am strong. I deserve the education that I get here. I have things to do  people to impress  and places to go.  And they said   Yeah   You say it long enough  it starts to be a part of you. I gave a quiz     questions. A student missed   . I put a      on his paper and a big smiley face. He said   Ms. Pierson  is this an F   I said   Yes.  He said   Then why'd you put a smiley face   I said   Because you're on a roll. You got two right. You didn't miss them all.  I said   And when we review this  won't you do better   He said   Yes  ma'am  I can do better.  You see        sucks all the life out of you.      said   I ain't all bad.  For years  I watched my mother take the time at recess to review  go on home visits in the afternoon  buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers to put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat  and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn't smell so good. See  it's hard to teach kids who stink. And kids can be cruel. And so she kept those things in her desk  and years later  after she retired  I watched some of those same kids come through and say to her   You know  Ms. Walker  you made a difference in my life. You made it work for me. You made me feel like I was somebody  when I knew  at the bottom  I wasn't. And I want you to just see what I've become.  And when my mama died two years ago at     there were so many former students at her funeral  it brought tears to my eyes  not because she was gone  but because she left a legacy of relationships that could never disappear. Can we stand to have more relationships  Absolutely. Will you like all your children  Of course not. And you know your toughest kids are never absent. Never. You won't like them all  and the tough ones show up for a reason. It's the connection. It's the relationships. So teachers become great actors and great actresses  and we come to work when we don't feel like it  and we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense  and we teach anyway. We teach anyway  because that's what we do. Teaching and learning should bring joy. How powerful would our world be if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks  who were not afraid to think  and who had a champion  Every child deserves a champion  an adult who will never give up on them  who understands the power of connection  and insists that they become the best that they can possibly be. Is this job tough  You betcha. Oh God  you betcha. But it is not impossible. We can do this. We're educators. We're born to make a difference. Thank you so much. In this talk today  I want to present a different idea for why investing in early childhood education makes sense as a public investment. It's a different idea  because usually  when people talk about early childhood programs  they talk about all the wonderful benefits for participants in terms of former participants  in preschool  they have better K    test scores  better adult earnings. Now that's all very important  but what I want to talk about is what preschool does for state economies and for promoting state economic development. And that's actually crucial because if we're going to get increased investment in early childhood programs  we need to interest state governments in this. The federal government has a lot on its plate  and state governments are going to have to step up. So we have to appeal to them  the legislators in the state government  and turn to something they understand  that they have to promote the economic development of their state economy. Now  by promoting economic development  I don't mean anything magical. All I mean is  is that early childhood education can bring more and better jobs to a state and can thereby promote higher per capita earnings for the state's residents. Now  I think it's fair to say that when people think about state and local economic development  they don't generally think first about what they're doing about childcare and early childhood programs. I know this. I've spent most of my career researching these programs. I've talked to a lot of directors of state economic development agencies about these issues  a lot of legislators about these issues. When legislators and others think about economic development  what they first of all think about are business tax incentives  property tax abatements  job creation tax credits  you know  there are a million of these programs all over the place. So for example  states compete very vigorously to attract new auto plants or expanded auto plants. They hand out all kinds of business tax breaks. Now  those programs can make sense if they in fact induce new location decisions  and the way they can make sense is  by creating more and better jobs  they raise employment rates  raise per capita earnings of state residents. So there is a benefit to state residents that corresponds to the costs that they're paying by paying for these business tax breaks. My argument is essentially that early childhood programs can do exactly the same thing  create more and better jobs  but in a different way. It's a somewhat more indirect way. These programs can promote more and better jobs by  you build it  you invest in high quality preschool  it develops the skills of your local workforce if enough of them stick around  and  in turn  that higher quality local workforce will be a key driver of creating jobs and creating higher earnings per capita in the local community. Now  let me turn to some numbers on this. Okay. If you look at the research evidence    that's extensive    on how much early childhood programs affect the educational attainment  wages and skills of former participants in preschool as adults  you take those known effects  you take how many of those folks will be expected to stick around the state or local economy and not move out  and you take research on how much skills drive job creation  you will conclude  from these three separate lines of research  that for every dollar invested in early childhood programs  the per capita earnings of state residents go up by two dollars and    cents  so that's a three to one return. Now you can get much higher returns  of up to    to one  if you include anti crime benefits  if you include benefits to former preschool participants who move to some other state  but there's a good reason for focusing on these three dollars because this is salient and important to state legislators and state policy makers  and it's the states that are going to have to act. So there is this key benefit that is relevant to state policy makers in terms of economic development. Now  one objection you often hear  or maybe you don't hear it because people are too polite to say it  is  why should I pay more taxes to invest in other people's children  What's in it for me  And the trouble with that objection  it reflects a total misunderstanding of how much local economies involve everyone being interdependent. Specifically  the interdependency here is  is that there are huge spillovers of skills    that when other people's children get more skills  that actually increases the prosperity of everyone  including people whose skills don't change. So for example  numerous research studies have shown if you look at what really drives the growth rate of metropolitan areas  it's not so much low taxes  low cost  low wages  it's the skills of the area. Particularly  the proxy for skills that people use is percentage of college graduates in the area. So when you look  for example  at metropolitan areas such as the Boston area  Minneapolis St. Paul  Silicon Valley  these areas are not doing well economically because they're low cost. I don't know if you ever tried to buy a house in Silicon Valley. It's not exactly a low cost proposition. They are growing because they have high levels of skills. So when we invest in other people's children  and build up those skills  we increase the overall job growth of a metro area. As another example  if we look at what determines an individual's wages  and we do statistical exploration of that  what determines wages  we know that the individual's wages will depend  in part  on that individual's education  for example whether or not they have a college degree. One of the very interesting facts is that  in addition  we find that even once we hold constant  statistically  the effect of your own education  the education of everyone else in your metropolitan area also affects your wages. So specifically  if you hold constant your education  you stick in percentage of college graduates in your metro area  you will find that has a significant positive effect on your wages without changing your education at all. In fact  this effect is so strong that when someone gets a college degree  the spillover effects of this on the wages of others in the metropolitan area are actually greater than the direct effects. So if someone gets a college degree  their lifetime earnings go up by a huge amount  over         dollars. There's an effect on everyone else in the metro area of driving up the percentage of college graduates in the metro area  and if you add that up    it's a small effect for each person  but if you add that up across all the people in the metro area  you actually get that the increase in wages for everyone else in the metropolitan area adds up to almost a million dollars. That's actually greater than the direct benefits of the person choosing to get education. Now  what's going on here  What can explain these huge spillover effects of education  Well  let's think about it this way. I can be the most skilled person in the world  but if everyone else at my firm lacks skills  my employer is going to find it more difficult to introduce new technology  new production techniques. So as a result  my employer is going to be less productive. They will not be able to afford to pay me as good wages. Even if everyone at my firm has good skills  if the workers at the suppliers to my firm do not have good skills  my firm is going to be less competitive competing in national and international markets. And again  the firm that's less competitive will not be able to pay as good wages  and then  particularly in high tech businesses  they're constantly stealing ideas and workers from other businesses. So clearly the productivity of firms in Silicon Valley has a lot to do with the skills not only of the workers at their firm  but the workers at all the other firms in the metro area. So as a result  if we can invest in other people's children through preschool and other early childhood programs that are high quality  we not only help those children  we help everyone in the metropolitan area gain in wages and we'll have the metropolitan area gain in job growth. Another objection used sometimes here to invest in early childhood programs is concern about people moving out. So  you know  maybe Ohio's thinking about investing in more preschool education for children in Columbus  Ohio  but they're worried that these little Buckeyes will  for some strange reason  decide to move to Ann Arbor  Michigan  and become Wolverines. And maybe Michigan will be thinking about investing in preschool in Ann Arbor  Michigan  and be worried these little Wolverines will end up moving to Ohio and becoming Buckeyes. And so they'll both underinvest because everyone's going to move out. Well  the reality is  if you look at the data  Americans aren't as hyper mobile as people sometimes assume. The data is that over    percent of Americans spend most of their working careers in the state they were born in  over    percent. That percentage does not vary much from state to state. It doesn't vary much with the state's economy  whether it's depressed or booming  it doesn't vary much over time. So the reality is  if you invest in kids  they will stay. Or at least  enough of them will stay that it will pay off for your state economy. Okay  so to sum up  there is a lot of research evidence that early childhood programs  if run in a high quality way  pay off in higher adult skills. There's a lot of research evidence that those folks will stick around the state economy  and there's a lot of evidence that having more workers with higher skills in your local economy pays off in higher wages and job growth for your local economy  and if you calculate the numbers for each dollar  we get about three dollars back in benefits for the state economy. So in my opinion  the research evidence is compelling and the logic of this is compelling. So what are the barriers to getting it done  Well  one obvious barrier is cost. So if you look at what it would cost if every state government invested in universal preschool at age four  full day preschool at age four  the total annual national cost would be roughly    billion dollars. So     billion dollars is a lot of money. On the other hand  if you reflect on that the U.S.'s population is over     million  we're talking about an amount of money that amounts to     dollars per capita. Okay  A hundred dollars per capita  per person  is something that any state government can afford to do. It's just a simple matter of political will to do it. And  of course  as I mentioned  this cost has corresponding benefits. I mentioned there's a multiplier of about three   .    for the state economy  in terms of over    billion in extra earnings. And if we want to translate that from just billions of dollars to something that might mean something  what we're talking about is that  for the average low income kid  that would increase earnings by about    percent over their whole career  just doing the preschool  not improving K    or anything else after that  not doing anything with college tuition or access  just directly improving preschool  and we would get five percent higher earnings for middle class kids. So this is an investment that pays off in very concrete terms for a broad range of income groups in the state's population and produces large and tangible benefits. Now  that's one barrier. I actually think the more profound barrier is the long term nature of the benefits from early childhood programs. So the argument I'm making is  is that we're increasing the quality of our local workforce  and thereby increasing economic development. Obviously if we have a preschool with four year olds  we're not sending these kids out at age five to work in the sweatshops  right  At least I hope not. So we're talking about an investment that in terms of impacts on the state economy is not going to really pay off for    or    years  and of course America is notorious for being a short term oriented society. Now one response you can make to this  and I sometimes have done this in talks  is people can talk about  there are benefits for these programs in reducing special ed and remedial education costs  there are benefits  parents care about preschool  maybe we'll get some migration effects from parents seeking good preschool  and I think those are true  but in some sense they're missing the point. Ultimately  this is something we're investing in now for the future. And so what I want to leave you with is what I think is the ultimate question. I mean  I'm an economist  but this is ultimately not an economic question  it's a moral question  Are we willing  as Americans  are we as a society still capable of making the political choice to sacrifice now by paying more taxes in order to improve the long term future of not only our kids  but our community  Are we still capable of that as a country  And that's something that each and every citizen and voter needs to ask themselves. Is that something that you are still invested in  that you still believe in the notion of investment  That is the notion of investment. You sacrifice now for a return later. So I think the research evidence on the benefits of early childhood programs for the local economy is extremely strong. However  the moral and political choice is still up to us  as citizens and as voters. Thank you very much.  Applause  Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher  one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty  the shape and the form of Chinese characters. Ever since then  I was fascinated by this incredible language. But to an outsider  it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China. Over the past few years  I've been wondering if I can break down this wall  so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so. I started thinking about how a new  fast method of learning Chinese might be useful. Since the age of five  I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence. I learned new characters every day during the course of the next    years. Since we only have five minutes  it's better that we have a fast and simpler way. A Chinese scholar would understand        characters. You only need       to understand the basic literacy. The top     will allow you to comprehend    percent of basic literature    enough to read road signs  restaurant menus  to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers. Today I'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works. You are ready  Open your mouth as wide as possible until it's square. You get a mouth. This is a person going for a walk. Person. If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides  as if she was yelling frantically   Help  I'm on fire      This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame  but I like to think that way. Whichever works for you. This is a tree. Tree. This is a mountain. The sun. The moon. The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west. I call these eight characters radicals. They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters. A person. If someone walks behind  that is  to follow.  As the old saying goes  two is company  three is a crowd. If a person stretched their arms wide  this person is saying   It was this big.  The person inside the mouth  the person is trapped. He's a prisoner  just like Jonah inside the whale. One tree is a tree. Two trees together  we have the woods. Three trees together  we create the forest. Put a plank underneath the tree  we have the foundation. Put a mouth on the top of the tree  that's  idiot.   Laughter  Easy to remember  since a talking tree is pretty idiotic. Remember fire  Two fires together  I get really hot. Three fires together  that's a lot of flames. Set the fire underneath the two trees  it's burning. For us  the sun is the source of prosperity. Two suns together  prosperous. Three together  that's sparkles. Put the sun and the moon shining together  it's brightness. It also means tomorrow  after a day and a night. The sun is coming up above the horizon. Sunrise. A door. Put a plank inside the door  it's a door bolt. Put a mouth inside the door  asking questions. Knock knock. Is anyone home  This person is sneaking out of a door  escaping  evading. On the left  we have a woman. Two women together  they have an argument. Three women together  be careful  it's adultery. So we have gone through almost    characters. By using this method  the first eight radicals will allow you to build   . The next group of eight characters will build an extra   . So with very little effort  you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters  which is the same as a Chinese eight year old. So after we know the characters  we start building phrases. For example  the mountain and the fire together  we have fire mountain. It's a volcano. We know Japan is the land of the rising sun. This is a sun placed with the origin  because Japan lies to the east of China. So a sun  origin together  we build Japan. A person behind Japan  what do we get  A Japanese person. The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other. In ancient China  that means in exile  because Chinese emperors  they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains. Nowadays  exile has turned into getting out. A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit. This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage. Thank you. Everyone needs a coach. It doesn't matter whether you're a basketball player  a tennis player  a gymnast or a bridge player. My bridge coach  Sharon Osberg  says there are more pictures of the back of her head than anyone else's in the world.  Laughter  Sorry  Sharon. Here you go. We all need people who will give us feedback. That's how we improve. Unfortunately  there's one group of people who get almost no systematic feedback to help them do their jobs better  and these people have one of the most important jobs in the world. I'm talking about teachers. When Melinda and I learned how little useful feedback most teachers get  we were blown away. Until recently  over    percent of teachers just got one word of feedback  Satisfactory. If all my bridge coach ever told me was that I was  satisfactory   I would have no hope of ever getting better. How would I know who was the best  How would I know what I was doing differently  Today  districts are revamping the way they evaluate teachers  but we still give them almost no feedback that actually helps them improve their practice. Our teachers deserve better. The system we have today isn't fair to them. It's not fair to students  and it's putting America's global leadership at risk. So today I want to talk about how we can help all teachers get the tools for improvement they want and deserve. Let's start by asking who's doing well. Well  unfortunately there's no international ranking tables for teacher feedback systems. So I looked at the countries whose students perform well academically  and looked at what they're doing to help their teachers improve. Consider the rankings for reading proficiency. The U.S. isn't number one. We're not even in the top   . We're tied for   th with Iceland and Poland. Now  out of all the places that do better than the U.S. in reading  how many of them have a formal system for helping teachers improve  Eleven out of   . The U.S. is tied for   th in reading  but we're   rd in science and   st in math. So there's really only one area where we're near the top  and that's in failing to give our teachers the help they need to develop their skills. Let's look at the best academic performer  the province of Shanghai  China. Now  they rank number one across the board  in reading  math and science  and one of the keys to Shanghai's incredible success is the way they help teachers keep improving. They made sure that younger teachers get a chance to watch master teachers at work. They have weekly study groups  where teachers get together and talk about what's working. They even require each teacher to observe and give feedback to their colleagues. You might ask  why is a system like this so important  It's because there's so much variation in the teaching profession. Some teachers are far more effective than others. In fact  there are teachers throughout the country who are helping their students make extraordinary gains. If today's average teacher could become as good as those teachers  our students would be blowing away the rest of the world. So we need a system that helps all our teachers be as good as the best. What would that system look like  Well  to find out  our foundation has been working with       teachers in districts across the country on a project called Measures of Effective Teaching. We had observers watch videos of teachers in the classroom and rate how they did on a range of practices. For example  did they ask their students challenging questions  Did they find multiple ways to explain an idea  We also had students fill out surveys with questions like   Does your teacher know when the class understands a lesson    Do you learn to correct your mistakes   And what we found is very exciting. First  the teachers who did well on these observations had far better student outcomes. So it tells us we're asking the right questions. And second  teachers in the program told us that these videos and these surveys from the students were very helpful diagnostic tools  because they pointed to specific places where they can improve. I want to show you what this video component of MET looks like in action. Let's talk about what's going on today. To get started  we're doing a peer review day  okay  A peer review day  and our goal by the end of class is for you to be able to determine whether or not you have moves to prove in your essays. My name is Sarah Brown Wessling. I am a high school English teacher at Johnston High School in Johnston  Iowa. Turn to somebody next to you. Tell them what you think I mean when I talk about moves to prove. I've talk about    I think that there is a difference for teachers between the abstract of how we see our practice and then the concrete reality of it. Okay  so I would like you to please bring up your papers. I think what video offers for us is a certain degree of reality. You can't really dispute what you see on the video  and there is a lot to be learned from that  and there are a lot of ways that we can grow as a profession when we actually get to see this. I just have a flip camera and a little tripod and invested in this tiny little wide angle lens. At the beginning of class  I just perch it in the back of the classroom. It's not a perfect shot. It doesn't catch every little thing that's going on. But I can hear the sound. I can see a lot. And I'm able to learn a lot from it. So it really has been a simple but powerful tool in my own reflection. All right  let's take a look at the long one first  okay  Once I'm finished taping  then I put it in my computer  and then I'll scan it and take a peek at it. If I don't write things down  I don't remember them. So having the notes is a part of my thinking process  and I discover what I'm seeing as I'm writing. I really have used it for my own personal growth and my own personal reflection on teaching strategy and methodology and classroom management  and just all of those different facets of the classroom. I'm glad that we've actually done the process before so we can kind of compare what works  what doesn't. I think that video exposes so much of what's intrinsic to us as teachers in ways that help us learn and help us understand  and then help our broader communities understand what this complex work is really all about. I think it is a way to exemplify and illustrate things that we cannot convey in a lesson plan  things you cannot convey in a standard  things that you cannot even sometimes convey in a book of pedagogy. Alrighty  everybody  have a great weekend. I'll see you later.  Every classroom could look like that  Bill Gates  One day  we'd like every classroom in America to look something like that. But we still have more work to do. Diagnosing areas where a teacher needs to improve is only half the battle. We also have to give them the tools they need to act on the diagnosis. If you learn that you need to improve the way you teach fractions  you should be able to watch a video of the best person in the world teaching fractions. So building this complete teacher feedback and improvement system won't be easy. For example  I know some teachers aren't immediately comfortable with the idea of a camera in the classroom. That's understandable  but our experience with MET suggests that if teachers manage the process  if they collect video in their own classrooms  and they pick the lessons they want to submit  a lot of them will be eager to participate. Building this system will also require a considerable investment. Our foundation estimates that it could cost up to five billion dollars. Now that's a big number  but to put it in perspective  it's less than two percent of what we spend every year on teacher salaries. The impact for teachers would be phenomenal. We would finally have a way to give them feedback  as well as the means to act on it. But this system would have an even more important benefit for our country. It would put us on a path to making sure all our students get a great education  find a career that's fulfilling and rewarding  and have a chance to live out their dreams. This wouldn't just make us a more successful country. It would also make us a more fair and just one  too. I'm excited about the opportunity to give all our teachers the support they want and deserve. I hope you are too. Thank you. I teach chemistry. All right  all right. So more than just explosions  chemistry is everywhere. Have you ever found yourself at a restaurant spacing out just doing this over and over  Some people nodding yes. Recently  I showed this to my students  and I just asked them to try and explain why it happened. The questions and conversations that followed were fascinating. Check out this video that Maddie from my period three class sent me that evening. Now obviously  as Maddie's chemistry teacher  I love that she went home and continued to geek out about this kind of ridiculous demonstration that we did in class. But what fascinated me more is that Maddie's curiosity took her to a new level. If you look inside that beaker  you might see a candle. Maddie's using temperature to extend this phenomenon to a new scenario. You know  questions and curiosity like Maddie's are magnets that draw us towards our teachers  and they transcend all technology or buzzwords in education. But if we place these technologies before student inquiry  we can be robbing ourselves of our greatest tool as teachers  our students' questions. For example  flipping a boring lecture from the classroom to the screen of a mobile device might save instructional time  but if it is the focus of our students' experience  it's the same dehumanizing chatter just wrapped up in fancy clothing. But if instead we have the guts to confuse our students  perplex them  and evoke real questions  through those questions  we as teachers have information that we can use to tailor robust and informed methods of blended instruction. So    st century lingo jargon mumbo jumbo aside  the truth is  I've been teaching for    years now  and it took a life threatening situation to snap me out of    years of pseudo teaching and help me realize that student questions are the seeds of real learning  not some scripted curriculum that gave them tidbits of random information. In May of       at    years old  with a two year old at home and my second child on the way  I was diagnosed with a large aneurysm at the base of my thoracic aorta. This led to open heart surgery. This is the actual real email from my doctor right there. Now  when I got this  I was    press Caps Lock    absolutely freaked out  okay  But I found surprising moments of comfort in the confidence that my surgeon embodied. Where did this guy get this confidence  the audacity of it  So when I asked him  he told me three things. He said first  his curiosity drove him to ask hard questions about the procedure  about what worked and what didn't work. Second  he embraced  and didn't fear  the messy process of trial and error  the inevitable process of trial and error. And third  through intense reflection  he gathered the information that he needed to design and revise the procedure  and then  with a steady hand  he saved my life. Now I absorbed a lot from these words of wisdom  and before I went back into the classroom that fall  I wrote down three rules of my own that I bring to my lesson planning still today. Rule number one  Curiosity comes first. Questions can be windows to great instruction  but not the other way around. Rule number two  Embrace the mess. We're all teachers. We know learning is ugly. And just because the scientific method is allocated to page five of section  .  of chapter one of the one that we all skip  okay  trial and error can still be an informal part of what we do every single day at Sacred Heart Cathedral in room    . And rule number three  Practice reflection. What we do is important. It deserves our care  but it also deserves our revision. Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms  As if what we are doing one day will save lives. Our students our worth it. And each case is different. All right. Sorry. The chemistry teacher in me just needed to get that out of my system before we move on. So these are my daughters. On the right we have little Emmalou    Southern family. And  on the left  Riley. Now Riley's going to be a big girl in a couple weeks here. She's going to be four years old  and anyone who knows a four year old knows that they love to ask   Why   Yeah. Why. I could teach this kid anything because she is curious about everything. We all were at that age. But the challenge is really for Riley's future teachers  the ones she has yet to meet. How will they grow this curiosity  You see  I would argue that Riley is a metaphor for all kids  and I think dropping out of school comes in many different forms    to the senior who's checked out before the year's even begun or that empty desk in the back of an urban middle school's classroom. But if we as educators leave behind this simple role as disseminators of content and embrace a new paradigm as cultivators of curiosity and inquiry  we just might bring a little bit more meaning to their school day  and spark their imagination. Thank you very much. So I grew up in East Los Angeles  not even realizing I was poor. My dad was a high ranking gang member who ran the streets. Everyone knew who I was  so I thought I was a pretty big deal  and I was protected  and even though my dad spent most of my life in and out of jail  I had an amazing mom who was just fiercely independent. She worked at the local high school as a secretary in the dean's office  so she got to see all the kids that got thrown out of class  for whatever reason  who were waiting to be disciplined. Man  her office was packed. So  see  kids like us  we have a lot of things to deal with outside of school  and sometimes we're just not ready to focus. But that doesn't mean that we can't. It just takes a little bit more. Like  I remember one day I found my dad convulsing  foaming at the mouth  OD ing on the bathroom floor. Really  do you think that doing my homework that night was at the top of my priority list  Not so much. But I really needed a support network  a group of people who were going to help me make sure that I wasn't going to be a victim of my own circumstance  that they were going to push me beyond what I even thought I could do. I needed teachers  in the classroom  every day  who were going to say   You can move beyond that.  And unfortunately  the local junior high was not going to offer that. It was gang infested  huge teacher turnover rate. So my mom said   You're going on a bus an hour and a half away from where we live every day.  So for the next two years  that's what I did. I took a school bus to the fancy side of town. And eventually  I ended up at a school where there was a mixture. There were some people who were really gang affiliated  and then there were those of us really trying to make it to high school. Well  trying to stay out of trouble was a little unavoidable. You had to survive. You just had to do things sometimes. So there were a lot of teachers who were like   She's never going to make it. She has an issue with authority. She's not going to go anywhere.  Some teachers completely wrote me off as a lost cause. But then  they were very surprised when I graduated from high school. I was accepted to Pepperdine University  and I came back to the same school that I attended to be a special ed assistant. And then I told them   I want to be a teacher.  And boy  they were like   What  Why  Why would you want to do that   So I began my teaching career at the exact same middle school that I attended  and I really wanted to try to save more kids who were just like me. And so every year  I share my background with my kids  because they need to know that everyone has a story  everyone has a struggle  and everyone needs help along the way. And I am going to be their help along the way. So as a rookie teacher  I created opportunity. I had a kid one day come into my class having been stabbed the night before. I was like   You need to go to a hospital  the school nurse  something.  He's like   No  Miss  I'm not going. I need to be in class because I need to graduate.  So he knew that I was not going to let him be a victim of his circumstance  but we were going to push forward and keep moving on. And this idea of creating a safe haven for our kids and getting to know exactly what they're going through  getting to know their families    I wanted that  but I couldn't do it in a school with       kids  and teachers turning over year after year after year. How do you get to build those relationships  So we created a new school. And we created the San Fernando Institute for Applied Media. And we made sure that we were still attached to our school district for funding  for support. But with that  we were going to gain freedom  freedom to hire the teachers that we knew were going to be effective  freedom to control the curriculum so that we're not doing lesson  .  on page five  no  and freedom to control a budget  to spend money where it matters  not how a district or a state says you have to do it. We wanted those freedoms. But now  shifting an entire paradigm  it hasn't been an easy journey  nor is it even complete. But we had to do it. Our community deserved a new way of doing things. And as the very first pilot middle school in all of Los Angeles Unified School District  you better believe there was some opposition. And it was out of fear    fear of  well  what if they get it wrong  Yeah  what if we get it wrong  But what if we get it right  And we did. So even though teachers were against it because we employ one year contracts    you can't teach  or you don't want to teach  you don't get to be at my school with my kids. So in our third year  how did we do it  Well  we're making school worth coming to every day. We make our kids feel like they matter to us. We make our curriculum rigorous and relevant to them  and they use all the technology that they're used to. Laptops  computers  tablets    you name it  they have it. Animation  software  moviemaking software  they have it all. And because we connect it to what they're doing   For example  they made public service announcements for the Cancer Society. These were played in the local trolley system. Teaching elements of persuasion  it doesn't get any more real than that. Our state test scores have gone up more than    points since we've become our own school. But it's taken all stakeholders  working together    teachers and principals on one year contracts  working over and above and beyond their contract hours without compensation. And it takes a school board member who is going to lobby for you and say   Know  the district is trying to impose this  but you have the freedom to do otherwise.  And it takes an active parent center who is not only there  showing a presence every day  but who is part of our governance  making decisions for their kids  our kids. Because why should our students have to go so far away from where they live  They deserve a quality school in their neighborhood  a school that they can be proud to say they attend  and a school that the community can be proud of as well  and they need teachers to fight for them every day and empower them to move beyond their circumstances. Because it's time that kids like me stop being the exception  and we become the norm. Thank you. I'm a little nervous  because my wife Yvonne said to me  she said   Geoff  you watch the TED Talks.  I said   Yes  honey  I love TED Talks.  She said   You know  they're like  really smart  talented      I said   I know  I know.   Laughter  She said   They don't want  like  the angry black man.  So I said   No  I'm gonna be good  Honey  I'm gonna be good. I am.  But I am angry.  Laughter  And the last time I looked  I'm    So this is why I'm excited but I'm angry. This year  there are going to be millions of our children that we're going to needlessly lose  that we could    right now  we could save them all. You saw the quality of the educators who were here. Do not tell me they could not reach those kids and save them. I know they could. It is absolutely possible. Why haven't we fixed this  Those of us in education have held on to a business plan that we don't care how many millions of young people fail  we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work  and nobody is getting crazy about it    right     enough to say   Enough is enough.  So here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense. You know  I grew up in the inner city  and there were kids who were failing in schools    years ago when I first went to school  and those schools are still lousy today     years later. And you know something about a lousy school  It's not like a bottle of wine. Right   Laughter  Where you say  like  '   was like a good year  right  That's now how this thing    I mean  every single year  it's still the same approach  right  One size fits all  if you get it  fine  and if you don't  tough luck. Just tough luck. Why haven't we allowed innovation to happen  Do not tell me we can't do better than this. Look  you go into a place that's failed kids for    years  and you say   So what's the plan   And they say   We'll  we're going to do what we did last year this year.  What kind of business model is that  Banks used to open and operate between    and  . They operated    to  . They were closed for lunch hour. Now  who can bank between    and    The unemployed. They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks. Who created that business model  Right  And it went on for decades. You know why  Because they didn't care. It wasn't about the customers. It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them. How could you go to the bank when you were at work  It didn't matter. And they don't care whether or not Geoff is upset he can't go to the bank. Go find another bank. They all operate the same way. Right  Now  one day  some crazy banker had an idea. Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work. They might like that. What about a Saturday  What about introducing technology  Now look  I'm a technology fan  but I have to admit to you all I'm a little old. So I was a little slow  and I did not trust technology  and when they first came out with those new contraptions  these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money  I was like   There's no way that machine is going to count that money right. I am never using that  right   So technology has changed. Things have changed. Yet not in education. Why  Why is it that when we had rotary phones  when we were having folks being crippled by polio  that we were teaching the same way then that we're doing right now  And if you come up with a plan to change things  people consider you radical. They will say the worst things about you. I said one day  well  look  if the science says    this is science  not me    that our poorest children lose ground in the summertime    You see where they are in June and say  okay  they're there. You look at them in September  they've gone down. You say  whoo  So I heard about that in '   when I was at the Ed School at Harvard. I said   Oh  wow  this is an important study.  Because it suggests we should do something. Every    years they reproduce the same study. It says exactly the same thing  Poor kids lose ground in the summertime. The system decides you can't run schools in the summer. You know  I always wonder  who makes up those rules  For years I went to    Look  I went the Harvard Ed School. I thought I knew something. They said it was the agrarian calendar  and people had   but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense. I never got that. I never got that  because anyone knows if you farm  you don't plant crops in July and August. You plant them in the spring. So who came up with this idea  Who owns it  Why did we ever do it  Well it just turns out in the     s we did have  schools were open all year. They were open all year  because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day. They didn't have any place for their kids to go. It was a perfect place to have schools. So this is not something that is ordained from the education gods. So why don't we  Why don't we  Because our business has refused to use science. Science. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying   Look  this works  right  We can do this.  How many places in America are going to change  None. None. Okay  yeah  there are two. All right  Yes  there'll be some place  because some folks will do the right thing. As a profession  we have to stop this. The science is clear. Here's what we know. We know that the problem begins immediately. Right  This idea  zero to three. My wife  Yvonne  and I  we have four kids  three grown ones and a    year old. That's a longer story. With our first kids  we did not know the science about brain development. We didn't know how critical those first three years were. We didn't know what was happening in those young brains. We didn't know the role that language  a stimulus and response  call and response  how important that was in developing those children. We know that now. What are we doing about it  Nothing. Wealthy people know. Educated people know. And their kids have an advantage. Poor people don't know  and we're not doing anything to help them at all. But we know this is critical. Now  you take pre kindergarten. We know it's important for kids. Poor kids need that experience. Nope. Lots of places  it doesn't exist. We know health services matter. You know  we provide health services and people are always fussing at me about  you know  because I'm all into accountability and data and all of that good stuff  but we do health services  and I have to raise a lot of money. People used to say when they'd come fund us   Geoff  why do you provide these health services   I used to make stuff up. Right  I'd say   Well  you know a child who has cavities is not going to  uh  be able to study as well.  And I had to because I had to raise the money. But now I'm older  and you know what I tell them  You know why I provide kids with those health benefits and the sports and the recreation and the arts  Because I actually like kids. I actually like kids.  Laughter   Applause  But when they really get pushy  people really get pushy  I say   I do it because you do it for your kid.  And you've never read a study from MIT that says giving your kid dance instruction is going to help them do algebra better  but you will give that kid dance instruction  and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction  and it will make your day. And why shouldn't poor kids have the same opportunity  It's the floor for these children. So here's the other thing. I'm a tester guy. I believe you need data  you need information  because you work at something  you think it's working  and you find out it's not working. I mean  you're educators. You work  you say  you think you've got it  great  no  And you find out they didn't get it. But here's the problem with testing. The testing that we do    we're going to have our test in New York next week   is in April. You know when we're going to get the results back  Maybe July  maybe June. And the results have great data. They'll tell you Raheem really struggled  couldn't do two digit multiplication    so great data  but you're getting it back after school is over. And so  what do you do  You go on vacation.  Laughter  You come back from vacation. Now you've got all of this test data from last year. You don't look at it. Why would you look at it  You're going to go and teach this year. So how much money did we just spend on all of that  Billions and billions of dollars for data that it's too late to use. I need that data in September. I need that data in November. I need to know you're struggling  and I need to know whether or not what I did corrected that. I need to know that this week. I don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late. Because in my older years  I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant. I can predict school scores. You take me to any school. I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling. And you tell me last year    percent of those kids were on grade level. And I say   Okay  what's the plan  what did we do from last year to this year   You say   We're doing the same thing.  I'm going to make a prediction.  Laughter  This year  somewhere between    and    percent of those kids will be on grade level. And I will be right every single time. So we're spending all of this money  but we're getting what  Teachers need real information right now about what's happening to their kids. The high stakes is today  because you can do something about it. So here's the other issue that I just think we've got to be concerned about. We can't stifle innovation in our business. We have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation. They get angry if you do something different. If you try something new  people are always like   Ooh  charter schools.  Hey  let's try some stuff. Let's see. This stuff hasn't worked for    years. Let's try something different. And here's the rub. Some of it's not going to work. You know  people tell me   Yeah  those charter schools  a lot of them don't work.  A lot of them don't. They should be closed. I mean  I really believe they should be closed. But we can't confuse figuring out the science and things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything. Right  Because that's not the way the world works. If you think about technology  imagine if that's how we thought about technology. Every time something didn't work  we just threw in the towel and said   Let's forget it.  Right  You know  they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me    the latest and greatest thing  the PalmPilot. They told me   Geoff  if you get this PalmPilot you'll never need another thing.  That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over. I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing. Did anybody stop inventing  Not a person. Not a soul. The folks went out there. They kept inventing. The fact that you have failure  that shouldn't stop you from pushing the science forward. Our job as educators  there's some stuff we know that we can do. And we've got to do better. The evaluation  we have to start with kids earlier  we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people. We've got to give them all of these opportunities. So that we have to do. But this innovation issue  this idea that we've got to keep innovating until we really nail this science down is something that is absolutely critical. And this is something  by the way  that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field. America cannot wait another    years to get this right. We have run out of time. I don't know about a fiscal cliff  but I know there's an educational cliff that we are walking over right this very second  and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness about saying we can't afford this   So Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars. What is five billion dollars to the United States  What did we spend in Afghanistan this year  How many trillions   Applause  When the country cares about something  we'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye. When the safety of America is threatened  we will spend any amount of money. The real safety of our nation is preparing this next generation so that they can take our place and be the leaders of the world when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy and all that stuff we care about. I dare say it's a pittance  what it would require for us to really begin to solve some of these problems. So once we do that  I'll no longer be angry.  Laughter  So  you guys  help me get there. Thank you all very much. Thank you. John Legend  So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone  Geoffrey Canada  Well  you know  John      percent of our kids graduated high school last year in my school. A hundred percent of them went to college. This year's seniors will have     percent graduating high school. Last I heard we had    percent accepted to college. We'd better get that other seven percent. So that's just how this goes.  Applause  JL  So how do you stick with them after they leave high school  GC  Well  you know  one of the bad problems we have in this country is these kids  the same kids  these same vulnerable kids  when you get them in school  they drop out in record numbers. And so we've figured out that you've got to really design a network of support for these kids that in many ways mimics what a good parent does. They harass you  right  They call you  they say   I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test  What are you talking about that you want to leave school  And you're not coming back here.  So a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem because Geoff is looking for you. They're like   I really can't come back.  No. You'd better stay in school. But I'm not kidding about some of this  and it gets a little bit to the grit issue. When kids know that you refuse to let them fail  it puts a different pressure on them  and they don't give up as easy. So sometimes they don't have it inside  and they're  like   You know  I don't want to do this  but I know my mother's going to be mad.  Well  that matters to kids  and it helps get them through. We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring and help and support  but also a set of encouragements that say to them   You can do it. It is going to be hard  but we refuse to let you fail.  JL  Well  thank you Dr. Canada. Please give it up for him one more time. When I was    years old  I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding  teaching. I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools. And like any teacher  I made quizzes and tests. I gave out homework assignments. When the work came back  I calculated grades. What struck me was that IQ was not the only difference between my best and my worst students. Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric IQ scores. Some of my smartest kids weren't doing so well. And that got me thinking. The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math  sure  they're hard  ratios  decimals  the area of a parallelogram. But these concepts are not impossible  and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough. After several more years of teaching  I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective  from a psychological perspective. In education  the one thing we know how to measure best is IQ. But what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily  So I left the classroom  and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist. I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings  and in every study my question was  who is successful here and why  My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy. We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out. We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition. We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods  asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year  and of those  who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students  We partnered with private companies  asking  which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs  And who's going to earn the most money  In all those very different contexts  one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success. And it wasn't social intelligence. It wasn't good looks  physical health  and it wasn't IQ. It was grit. Grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals. Grit is having stamina. Grit is sticking with your future  day in  day out  not just for the week  not just for the month  but for years  and working really hard to make that future a reality. Grit is living life like it's a marathon  not a sprint. A few years ago  I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools. I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires  and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate. Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate  even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure  things like family income  standardized achievement test scores  even how safe kids felt when they were at school. So it's not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters. It's also in school  especially for kids at risk for dropping out. To me  the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know  how little science knows  about building it. Every day  parents and teachers ask me   How do I build grit in kids  What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic  How do I keep them motivated for the long run   The honest answer is  I don't know. What I do know is that talent doesn't make you gritty. Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments. In fact  in our data  grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent. So far  the best idea I've heard about building grit in kids is something called  growth mindset.  This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck  and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed  that it can change with your effort. Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge  they're much more likely to persevere when they fail  because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition. So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit. But we need more. And that's where I'm going to end my remarks  because that's where we are. That's the work that stands before us. We need to take our best ideas  our strongest intuitions  and we need to test them. We need to measure whether we've been successful  and we have to be willing to fail  to be wrong  to start over again with lessons learned. In other words  we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier. Thank you. Thank you very much. I moved to America    years ago with my wife Terry and our two kids. Actually  truthfully  we moved to Los Angeles    thinking we were moving to America  but anyway    It's a short plane ride from Los Angeles to America. I got here    years ago  and when I got here  I was told various things  like   Americans don't get irony.  Have you come across this idea  It's not true. I've traveled the whole length and breadth of this country. I have found no evidence that Americans don't get irony. It's one of those cultural myths  like   The British are reserved.  I don't know why people think this. We've invaded every country we've encountered. But it's not true Americans don't get irony  but I just want you to know that that's what people are saying about you behind your back. You know  so when you leave living rooms in Europe  people say  thankfully  nobody was ironic in your presence. But I knew that Americans get irony when I came across that legislation   No Child Left Behind.  Because whoever thought of that title gets irony. Don't they  Because it's leaving millions of children behind. Now I can see that's not a very attractive name for legislation   Millions of Children Left Behind.  I can see that. What's the plan  We propose to leave millions of children behind  and here's how it's going to work. And it's working beautifully. In some parts of the country     percent of kids drop out of high school. In the Native American communities  it's    percent of kids. If we halved that number  one estimate is it would create a net gain to the U.S. economy over    years  of nearly a trillion dollars. From an economic point of view  this is good math  isn't it  that we should do this  It actually costs an enormous amount to mop up the damage from the dropout crisis. But the dropout crisis is just the tip of an iceberg. What it doesn't count are all the kids who are in school but being disengaged from it  who don't enjoy it  who don't get any real benefit from it. And the reason is not that we're not spending enough money. America spends more money on education than most other countries. Class sizes are smaller than in many countries. And there are hundreds of initiatives every year to try and improve education. The trouble is  it's all going in the wrong direction. There are three principles on which human life flourishes  and they are contradicted by the culture of education under which most teachers have to labor and most students have to endure. The first is this  that human beings are naturally different and diverse. Can I ask you  how many of you have got children of your own  Okay. Or grandchildren. How about two children or more  Right. And the rest of you have seen such children. Small people wandering about. I will make you a bet  and I am confident that I will win the bet. If you've got two children or more  I bet you they are completely different from each other. Aren't they  You would never confuse them  would you  Like   Which one are you  Remind me.   Your mother and I need some color coding system so we don't get confused.  Education under  No Child Left Behind  is based on not diversity but conformity. What schools are encouraged to do is to find out what kids can do across a very narrow spectrum of achievement. One of the effects of  No Child Left Behind  has been to narrow the focus onto the so called STEM disciplines. They're very important. I'm not here to argue against science and math. On the contrary  they're necessary but they're not sufficient. A real education has to give equal weight to the arts  the humanities  to physical education. An awful lot of kids  sorry  thank you    One estimate in America currently is that something like    percent of kids  getting on that way  are being diagnosed with various conditions under the broad title of attention deficit disorder. ADHD. I'm not saying there's no such thing. I just don't believe it's an epidemic like this. If you sit kids down  hour after hour  doing low grade clerical work  don't be surprised if they start to fidget  you know  Children are not  for the most part  suffering from a psychological condition. They're suffering from childhood. And I know this because I spent my early life as a child. I went through the whole thing. Kids prosper best with a broad curriculum that celebrates their various talents  not just a small range of them. And by the way  the arts aren't just important because they improve math scores. They're important because they speak to parts of children's being which are otherwise untouched. The second  thank you    The second principle that drives human life flourishing is curiosity. If you can light the spark of curiosity in a child  they will learn without any further assistance  very often. Children are natural learners. It's a real achievement to put that particular ability out  or to stifle it. Curiosity is the engine of achievement. Now the reason I say this is because one of the effects of the current culture here  if I can say so  has been to de professionalize teachers. There is no system in the world or any school in the country that is better than its teachers. Teachers are the lifeblood of the success of schools. But teaching is a creative profession. Teaching  properly conceived  is not a delivery system. You know  you're not there just to pass on received information. Great teachers do that  but what great teachers also do is mentor  stimulate  provoke  engage. You see  in the end  education is about learning. If there's no learning going on  there's no education going on. And people can spend an awful lot of time discussing education without ever discussing learning. The whole point of education is to get people to learn. An old friend of mine    actually very old  he's dead. That's as old as it gets  I'm afraid. But a wonderful guy he was  wonderful philosopher. He used to talk about the difference between the task and achievement senses of verbs. You can be engaged in the activity of something  but not really be achieving it  like dieting. It's a very good example. There he is. He's dieting. Is he losing any weight  Not really. Teaching is a word like that. You can say   There's Deborah  she's in room     she's teaching.  But if nobody's learning anything  she may be engaged in the task of teaching but not actually fulfilling it. The role of a teacher is to facilitate learning. That's it. And part of the problem is  I think  that the dominant culture of education has come to focus on not teaching and learning  but testing. Now  testing is important. Standardized tests have a place. But they should not be the dominant culture of education. They should be diagnostic. They should help. If I go for a medical examination  I want some standardized tests. I do. I want to know what my cholesterol level is compared to everybody else's on a standard scale. I don't want to be told on some scale my doctor invented in the car.  Your cholesterol is what I call Level Orange.   Really    Is that good    We don't know.  But all that should support learning. It shouldn't obstruct it  which of course it often does. So in place of curiosity  what we have is a culture of compliance. Our children and teachers are encouraged to follow routine algorithms rather than to excite that power of imagination and curiosity. And the third principle is this  that human life is inherently creative. It's why we all have different r sum s. We create our lives  and we can recreate them as we go through them. It's the common currency of being a human being. It's why human culture is so interesting and diverse and dynamic. I mean  other animals may well have imaginations and creativity  but it's not so much in evidence  is it  as ours  I mean  you may have a dog. And your dog may get depressed. You know  but it doesn't listen to Radiohead  does it  And sit staring out the window with a bottle of Jack Daniels.  Would you like to come for a walk    No  I'm fine.   You go. I'll wait. But take pictures.  We all create our own lives through this restless process of imagining alternatives and possibilities  and one of the roles of education is to awaken and develop these powers of creativity. Instead  what we have is a culture of standardization. Now  it doesn't have to be that way. It really doesn't. Finland regularly comes out on top in math  science and reading. Now  we only know that's what they do well at  because that's all that's being tested. That's one of the problems of the test. They don't look for other things that matter just as much. The thing about work in Finland is this  they don't obsess about those disciplines. They have a very broad approach to education  which includes humanities  physical education  the arts. Second  there is no standardized testing in Finland. I mean  there's a bit  but it's not what gets people up in the morning  what keeps them at their desks. The third thing    and I was at a meeting recently with some people from Finland  actual Finnish people  and somebody from the American system was saying to the people in Finland   What do you do about the drop out rate in Finland   And they all looked a bit bemused  and said   Well  we don't have one. Why would you drop out  If people are in trouble  we get to them quite quickly and we help and support them.  Now people always say   Well  you know  you can't compare Finland to America.  No. I think there's a population of around five million in Finland. But you can compare it to a state in America. Many states in America have fewer people in them than that. I mean  I've been to some states in America and I was the only person there. Really. Really. I was asked to lock up when I left. But what all the high performing systems in the world do is currently what is not evident  sadly  across the systems in America    I mean  as a whole. One is this  they individualize teaching and learning. They recognize that it's students who are learning and the system has to engage them  their curiosity  their individuality  and their creativity. That's how you get them to learn. The second is that they attribute a very high status to the teaching profession. They recognize that you can't improve education if you don't pick great people to teach and keep giving them constant support and professional development. Investing in professional development is not a cost. It's an investment  and every other country that's succeeding well knows that  whether it's Australia  Canada  South Korea  Singapore  Hong Kong or Shanghai. They know that to be the case. And the third is  they devolve responsibility to the school level for getting the job done. You see  there's a big difference here between going into a mode of command and control in education    That's what happens in some systems. Central or state governments decide  they know best and they're going to tell you what to do. The trouble is that education doesn't go on in the committee rooms of our legislative buildings. It happens in classrooms and schools  and the people who do it are the teachers and the students  and if you remove their discretion  it stops working. You have to put it back to the people. There is wonderful work happening in this country. But I have to say it's happening in spite of the dominant culture of education  not because of it. It's like people are sailing into a headwind all the time. And the reason I think is this  that many of the current policies are based on mechanistic conceptions of education. It's like education is an industrial process that can be improved just by having better data  and somewhere in the back of the mind of some policy makers is this idea that if we fine tune it well enough  if we just get it right  it will all hum along perfectly into the future. It won't  and it never did. The point is that education is not a mechanical system. It's a human system. It's about people  people who either do want to learn or don't want to learn. Every student who drops out of school has a reason for it which is rooted in their own biography. They may find it boring. They may find it irrelevant. They may find that it's at odds with the life they're living outside of school. There are trends  but the stories are always unique. I was at a meeting recently in Los Angeles of    they're called alternative education programs. These are programs designed to get kids back into education. They have certain common features. They're very personalized. They have strong support for the teachers  close links with the community and a broad and diverse curriculum  and often programs which involve students outside school as well as inside school. And they work. What's interesting to me is  these are called  alternative education.  You know  And all the evidence from around the world is  if we all did that  there'd be no need for the alternative. So I think we have to embrace a different metaphor. We have to recognize that it's a human system  and there are conditions under which people thrive  and conditions under which they don't. We are after all organic creatures  and the culture of the school is absolutely essential. Culture is an organic term  isn't it  Not far from where I live is a place called Death Valley. Death Valley is the hottest  driest place in America  and nothing grows there. Nothing grows there because it doesn't rain. Hence  Death Valley. In the winter of       it rained in Death Valley. Seven inches of rain fell over a very short period. And in the spring of       there was a phenomenon. The whole floor of Death Valley was carpeted in flowers for a while. What it proved is this  that Death Valley isn't dead. It's dormant. Right beneath the surface are these seeds of possibility waiting for the right conditions to come about  and with organic systems  if the conditions are right  life is inevitable. It happens all the time. You take an area  a school  a district  you change the conditions  give people a different sense of possibility  a different set of expectations  a broader range of opportunities  you cherish and value the relationships between teachers and learners  you offer people the discretion to be creative and to innovate in what they do  and schools that were once bereft spring to life. Great leaders know that. The real role of leadership in education    and I think it's true at the national level  the state level  at the school level    is not and should not be command and control. The real role of leadership is climate control  creating a climate of possibility. And if you do that  people will rise to it and achieve things that you completely did not anticipate and couldn't have expected. There's a wonderful quote from Benjamin Franklin.  There are three sorts of people in the world  Those who are immovable  people who don't get it  or don't want to do anything about it  there are people who are movable  people who see the need for change and are prepared to listen to it  and there are people who move  people who make things happen.  And if we can encourage more people  that will be a movement. And if the movement is strong enough  that's  in the best sense of the word  a revolution. And that's what we need. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. When I was in my   s  I saw my very first psychotherapy client. I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley. She was a    year old woman named Alex. Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top  and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems. Now when I heard this  I was so relieved. My classmate got an arsonist for her first client. And I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys. This I thought I could handle. But I didn't handle it. With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session  it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road.  Thirty's the new      Alex would say  and as far as I could tell  she was right. Work happened later  marriage happened later  kids happened later  even death happened later. Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time. But before long  my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life. I pushed back. I said   Sure  she's dating down  she's sleeping with a knucklehead  but it's not like she's going to marry the guy.  And then my supervisor said   Not yet  but she might marry the next one. Besides  the best time to work on Alex's marriage is before she has one.  That's what psychologists call an  Aha   moment. That was the moment I realized     is not the new   . Yes  people settle down later than they used to  but that didn't make Alex's   s a developmental downtime. That made Alex's   s a developmental sweet spot  and we were sitting there  blowing it. That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem  and it had real consequences  not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere. There are    million twentysomethings in the United States right now. We're talking about    percent of the population  or     percent if you consider that no one's getting through adulthood without going through their   s first. Raise your hand if you're in your   s. I really want to see some twentysomethings here. Oh  yay  You are all awesome. If you work with twentysomethings  you love a twentysomething  you're losing sleep over twentysomethings  I want to see   Okay. Awesome  twentysomethings really matter. So  I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe that every single one of those    million twentysomethings deserves to know what psychologists  sociologists  neurologists and fertility specialists already know  that claiming your   s is one of the simplest  yet most transformative  things you can do for work  for love  for your happiness  maybe even for the world. This is not my opinion. These are the facts. We know that    percent of life's most defining moments take place by age   . That means that eight out of    of the decisions and experiences and  Aha   moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid   s. People who are over     don't panic. This crowd is going to be fine  I think. We know that the first    years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you're going to earn. We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by   . We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your   s as it rewires itself for adulthood  which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself  now is the time to change it. We know that personality changes more during your   s than at any other time in life  and we know that female fertility peaks at age     and things get tricky after age   . So your   s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options. So when we think about child development  we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain. It's a time when your ordinary  day to day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become. But what we hear less about is that there's such a thing as adult development  and our   s are that critical period of adult development. But this isn't what twentysomethings are hearing. Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood. Researchers call the   s an extended adolescence. Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings like  twixters  and  kidults.  As a culture  we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood. Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things  you need a plan and not quite enough time. So what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say   You have    extra years to start your life   Nothing happens. You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition  and absolutely nothing happens. And then every day  smart  interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this   I know my boyfriend's no good for me  but this relationship doesn't count. I'm just killing time.  Or they say   Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time I'm     I'll be fine.  But then it starts to sound like this   My   s are almost over  and I have nothing to show for myself. I had a better r sum  the day after I graduated from college.  And then it starts to sound like this   Dating in my   s was like musical chairs. Everybody was running around and having fun  but then sometime around    it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down. I didn't want to be the only one left standing up  so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at   .  Where are the twentysomethings here  Do not do that. Okay  now that sounds a little flip  but make no mistake  the stakes are very high. When a lot has been pushed to your   s  there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump start a career  pick a city  partner up  and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time. Many of these things are incompatible  and as research is just starting to show  simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our   s. The post millennial midlife crisis isn't buying a red sports car. It's realizing you can't have that career you now want. It's realizing you can't have that child you now want  or you can't give your child a sibling. Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves  and at me  sitting across the room  and say about their   s   What was I doing  What was I thinking   I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking. Here's a story about how that can go. It's a story about a woman named Emma. At     Emma came to my office because she was  in her words  having an identity crisis. She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment  but she hadn't decided yet  so she'd spent the last few years waiting tables instead. Because it was cheaper  she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition. And as hard as her   s were  her early life had been even harder. She often cried in our sessions  but then would collect herself by saying   You can't pick your family  but you can pick your friends.  Well one day  Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap  and she sobbed for most of the hour. She'd just bought a new address book  and she'd spent the morning filling in her many contacts  but then she'd been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words  In case of emergency  please call ...  She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said   Who's going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck  Who's going to take care of me if I have cancer   Now in that moment  it took everything I had not to say   I will.  But what Emma needed wasn't some therapist who really  really cared. Emma needed a better life  and I knew this was her chance. I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex to just sit there while Emma's defining decade went parading by. So over the next weeks and months  I told Emma three things that every twentysomething  male or female  deserves to hear. First  I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital. By  get identity capital   I mean do something that adds value to who you are. Do something that's an investment in who you might want to be next. I didn't know the future of Emma's career  and no one knows the future of work  but I do know this  Identity capital begets identity capital. So now is the time for that cross country job  that internship  that startup you want to try. I'm not discounting twentysomething exploration here  but I am discounting exploration that's not supposed to count  which  by the way  is not exploration. That's procrastination. I told Emma to explore work and make it count. Second  I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated. Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport  but twentysomethings who huddle together with like minded peers limit who they know  what they know  how they think  how they speak  and where they work. That new piece of capital  that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle. New things come from what are called our weak ties  our friends of friends of friends. So yes  half of twentysomethings are un  or under employed. But half aren't  and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group. Half of new jobs are never posted  so reaching out to your neighbor's boss is how you get that unposted job. It's not cheating. It's the science of how information spreads. Last but not least  Emma believed that you can't pick your family  but you can pick your friends. Now this was true for her growing up  but as a twentysomething  soon Emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own. I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now. Now you may be thinking that    is actually a better time to settle down than     or even     and I agree with you. But grabbing whoever you're living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress. The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one  and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work. Picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you. So what happened to Emma  Well  we went through that address book  and she found an old roommate's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state. That weak tie helped her get a job there. That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live in boyfriend. Now  five years later  she's a special events planner for museums. She's married to a man she mindfully chose. She loves her new career  she loves her new family  and she sent me a card that said   Now the emergency contact blanks don't seem big enough.  Now Emma's story made that sound easy  but that's what I love about working with twentysomethings. They are so easy to help. Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX  bound for somewhere west. Right after takeoff  a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji. Likewise  at    or    or even     one good conversation  one good break  one good TED Talk  can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come. So here's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know. It's as simple as what I learned to say to Alex. It's what I now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day  Thirty is not the new     so claim your adulthood  get some identity capital  use your weak ties  pick your family. Don't be defined by what you didn't know or didn't do. You're deciding your life right now. Thank you.  Don't talk to strangers.  You have heard that phrase uttered by your friends  family  schools and the media for decades. It's a norm. It's a social norm. But it's a special kind of social norm  because it's a social norm that wants to tell us who we can relate to and who we shouldn't relate to.  Don't talk to strangers  says   Stay from anyone who's not familiar to you. Stick with the people you know. Stick with people like you.  How appealing is that  It's not really what we do  is it  when we're at our best  When we're at our best  we reach out to people who are not like us  because when we do that  we learn from people who are not like us. My phrase for this value of being with  not like us  is  strangeness   and my point is that in today's digitally intensive world  strangers are quite frankly not the point. The point that we should be worried about is  how much strangeness are we getting  Why strangeness  Because our social relations are increasingly mediated by data  and data turns our social relations into digital relations  and that means that our digital relations now depend extraordinarily on technology to bring to them a sense of robustness  a sense of discovery  a sense of surprise and unpredictability. Why not strangers  Because strangers are part of a world of really rigid boundaries. They belong to a world of people I know versus people I don't know  and in the context of my digital relations  I'm already doing things with people I don't know. The question isn't whether or not I know you. The question is  what can I do with you  What can I learn with you  What can we do together that benefits us both  I spend a lot of time thinking about how the social landscape is changing  how new technologies create new constraints and new opportunities for people. The most important changes facing us today have to do with data and what data is doing to shape the kinds of digital relations that will be possible for us in the future. The economies of the future depend on that. Our social lives in the future depend on that. The threat to worry about isn't strangers. The threat to worry about is whether or not we're getting our fair share of strangeness. Now    th century psychologists and sociologists were thinking about strangers  but they weren't thinking so dynamically about human relations  and they were thinking about strangers in the context of influencing practices. Stanley Milgram from the '  s and '  s  the creator of the small world experiments  which became later popularized as six degrees of separation  made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps. His point was that strangers are out there. We can reach them. There are paths that enable us to reach them. Mark Granovetter  Stanford sociologist  in      in his seminal essay  The Strength of Weak Ties   made the point that these weak ties that are a part of our networks  these strangers  are actually more effective at diffusing information to us than are our strong ties  the people closest to us. He makes an additional indictment of our strong ties when he says that these people who are so close to us  these strong ties in our lives  actually have a homogenizing effect on us. They produce sameness. My colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years looking at the ways in which digital platforms are reshaping our everyday lives  what kinds of new routines are possible. We've been looking specifically at the kinds of digital platforms that have enabled us to take our possessions  those things that used to be very restricted to us and to our friends in our houses  and to make them available to people we don't know. Whether it's our clothes  whether it's our cars  whether it's our bikes  whether it's our books or music  we are able to take our possessions now and make them available to people we've never met. And we concluded a very important insight  which was that as people's relationships to the things in their lives change  so do their relations with other people. And yet recommendation system after recommendation system continues to miss the boat. It continues to try to predict what I need based on some past characterization of who I am  of what I've already done. Security technology after security technology continues to design data protection in terms of threats and attacks  keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations. Categories like  friends  and  family  and  contacts  and  colleagues  don't tell me anything about my actual relations. A more effective way to think about my relations might be in terms of closeness and distance  where at any given point in time  with any single person  I am both close and distant from that individual  all as a function of what I need to do right now. People aren't close or distant. People are always a combination of the two  and that combination is constantly changing. What if technologies could intervene to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships  What if technologies could intervene to help me find the person that I need right now  Strangeness is that calibration of closeness and distance that enables me to find the people that I need right now  that enables me to find the sources of intimacy  of discovery  and of inspiration that I need right now. Strangeness is not about meeting strangers. It simply makes the point that we need to disrupt our zones of familiarity. So jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness  and it's a problem faced not just by individuals today  but also by organizations  organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities. Whether you're a political party insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion of who belongs and who does not  whether you're the government protecting social institutions like marriage and restricting access of those institutions to the few  whether you're a teenager in her bedroom who's trying to jostle her relations with her parents  strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way to new kinds of relations. We have to change the norms. We have to change the norms in order to enable new kinds of technologies as a basis for new kinds of businesses. What interesting questions lie ahead for us in this world of no strangers  How might we think differently about our relations with people  How might we think differently about our relations with distributed groups of people  How might we think differently about our relations with technologies  things that effectively become social participants in their own right  The range of digital relations is extraordinary. In the context of this broad range of digital relations  safely seeking strangeness might very well be a new basis for that innovation. Thank you. Liu Bolin  By making myself invisible  I try to question the inter canceling relationship between our civilization and its development. Interpreter  By making myself invisible  I try to explore and question the contradictory and often inter canceling relationship between our civilization and its development. LB  This is my first work  created in November     . And this is Beijing International Art Camp where I worked before the government forcibly demolished it.I used this work to express my objection. I also want to use this work to let more people pay attention to the living condition of artists and the condition of their creative freedom. In the meantime  from the beginning  this series has a protesting  reflective and uncompromising spirit. When applying makeup  I borrow a sniper's method to better protect myself and to detect the enemy  as he did.  Laughter  After finishing this series of protests  I started questioning why my fate was like this  and I realized that it's not just me    all Chinese are as confused as I am. As you can see  these works are about family planning  election in accordance with the law and propaganda of the institution of the People's Congress. This work is called Xia Gang   leaving post  .  Xia Gang  is a Chinese euphemism for  laid off . It refers to those people who lost their jobs during China's transition from a planned economy to a market economy. From      to         .   million people lost their jobs in China. The six people in the photo are Xia Gang workers. I made them invisible in the deserted shop wherethey had lived and worked all their lives. On the wall behind them is the slogan of the Cultural Revolution   The core force leading our cause forward is the Chinese Communist Party.  For half a month I looked for these   people to participate in my work. We can only see six men in this picture but in fact  those who are hidden here are all people who were laid off. They have just been made invisible. This piece is called The Studio. This spring  I happened to have an opportunity during my solo exhibition in Paris to shoot a work in the news studio of France      I picked the news photos of the day. One is about the war in the Middle East  and another one is about a public demonstration in France. I found that any culture has its irreconcilable contradictions. This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR. Interpreter  This is a joint effort between me and French artist JR. LB  I tried to disappear into JR's eye  but the problem is JR only uses models with big eyes. So I tried to make my eyes bigger with my fingers. But still they are not big enough for JR  unfortunately. Interpreter  So I tried to disappear into JR's eye  but the problem is JR uses only models with big eyes. So I tried to make my eyes bigger with this gesture. But it doesn't work  my eyes are still small. LB  This one is about      memories. This is an aircraft carrier moored alongside the Hudson River. Kenny Scharf's graffiti. This is Venice  Italy. Because global temperatures rise  the sea level rises  and it is said thatVenice will disappear in the coming decades. This is the ancient city of Pompeii. Interpreter  This is the ancient city of Pompeii. LB  This is the Borghese Gallery in Rome. When I work on a new piece  I pay more attention to the expression of ideas. For instance  why would I make myself invisible  What will making myself invisible here cause people to think  This one is called Instant Noodles. Interpreter  This one is called Instant Noodles.  Laughter  LB  Since August       harmful phosphors have been found in the instant noodle package cups from every famous brand sold in China's supermarkets. These phosphors can even cause cancer. To create this artwork  I bought a lot of packaged instant noodle cups and put them in my studio  making it look like a supermarket. And my task is to stand there  trying to be still  setting up the camera position and coordinating with my assistant and drawing the colors and shapes that are behind my body on the front of my body. If the background is simple  I usually have to stand for three to four hours. The background of this piece is more complex  so I need three to four days in advance for preparation. This is the suit I wore when I did the supermarket shoot. There is no Photoshop involved. Interpreter  This is the suit I  was  wearing when I did the supermarket shoot. There is no Photoshop involved.  Laughter  LB  These works are on China's cultural memories. And this one  this is about food safety in China. Unsafe food can harm people's health  and a deluge of magazines can confuse people's minds.  Laughter  The next pieces of work show how I made myself invisible in magazines of different languages  in different countries and at different times. I think that in art  an artist's attitude is the most important element. If an artwork is to touch someone  it must be the result of not only technique  but also the artist's thinking and struggle in life. And the repeated struggles in life create artwork  no matter in what form. That's all I want to say. Thank you.  Applause  Hey guys. It's funny  someone just mentioned MacGyver  because that was  like  I loved it  and when I was seven  I taped a fork to a drill and I was like   Hey  Mom  I'm going to Olive Garden.  And     Drilling noise   Laughter  And it worked really well there. And you know  it had a profound effect on me. It sounds silly  but I thought  okay  the way the world works can be changed  and it can be changed by me in these small ways. And my relationship to especially human made objects which someone else said they work like this  well  I can say they work a different way  a little bit. And so  about    years later  I didn't realize the full effect of this  but I went to Costa Rica and I stayed with these Guaym  natives there  and they could pull leaves off of trees and make shingles out of them  and they could make beds out of trees  and they could    I watched this woman for three days. I was there. She was peeling this palm frond apart  these little threads off of it  and she'd roll the threads together and make little thicker threads  like strings  and she would weave the strings together  and as the materiality of this exact very bag formed before my eyes over those three days  the materiality of the way the world works  of reality  kind of started to unravel in my mind  because I realized that this bag and these clothes and the trampoline you have at home and the pencil sharpener  everything you have is made out of either a tree or a rock or something we dug out of the ground and did some process to  maybe a more complicated one  but still  everything was made that way. And so I had to start studying  who is it that's making these decisions  Who's making these things  How did they make them  What stops us from making them  Because this is how reality is created. So I started right away. I was at MIT Media Lab  and I was studying the maker movement and makers and creativity. And I started in nature  because I saw these Guaym s doing it in nature  and there just seems to be less barriers. So I went to Vermont to Not Back to School Camp  where there's unschoolers who are just kind of hanging out and willing to try anything. So I said   Let's go into the woods near this stream and just put stuff together  you know  make something  I don't care  geometrical shapes  just grab some junk from around you. We won't bring anything with us. And  like  within minutes  this is very easy for adults and teens to do. Here's a triangle that was being formed underneath a flowing stream  and the shape of an oak leaf being made by other small oak leaves being put together. A leaf tied to a stick with a blade of grass. The materiality and fleshiness and meat of the mushroom being explored by how it can hold up different objects being stuck into it. And after about    minutes  you get really intricate projects like leaves sorted by hue  so you get a color fade and put in a circle like a wreath. And the creator of this  he said   This is fire. I call this fire.  And someone asked him   How do you get those sticks to stay on that tree   And he's like   I don't know  but I can show you.  And I'm like   Wow  that's really amazing. He doesn't know  but he can show you.  So his hands know and his intuition knows  but sometimes what we know gets in the way of what could be  especially when it comes to the human made  human built world. We think we already know how something works  so we can't imagine how it could work. We know how it's supposed to work  so we can't suppose all the things that could be possible. So kids don't have as hard of a time with this  and I saw in my own son  I gave him this book. I'm a good hippie dad  so I'm like   Okay  you're going to learn to love the moon. I'm going to give you some building blocks and they're nonrectilinear cactus building blocks  so it's totally legit.  But he doesn't really know what to do with these. I didn't show him. And so he's like   Okay  I'll just mess around with this.  This is no different than the sticks are to the teens in the forest. Just going to try to put them in shapes and push on them and stuff. And before long  he's kind of got this mechanism where you can almost launch and catapult objects around  and he enlists us in helping him. And at this point  I'm starting to wonder  what kind of tools can we give people  especially adults  who know too much  so that they can see the world as malleable  so they see themselves as agents of change in their everyday lives. Because the most advanced scientists are really just kind of pushing the way the world itself works  pushing what matter can do  the most advanced artists are just pushing the medium  and any sufficiently complicated task  whether you're a cook or a carpenter or you're raising a child    anything that's complicated    comes up with problems that aren't solved in the middle of it  and you can't do a good job getting it done unless you can say   Okay  well we're just going to have to refigure this. I don't care that pencils are supposed to be for writing. I'm going to use them a different way.  So let me show you a little demo. This is a little piano circuit right in here  and this is an ordinary paintbrush that I smashed it together with.  Beeping  And so  with some ketchup     musical notes    and then I can kind of    musical notes    And that's awesome  right  But this is not what's awesome. What's awesome is what happens when you give the piano circuit to people. A pencil is not just a pencil. Look what it has in the middle of it. That's a wire running down the middle  and not only is it a wire  if you take that piano circuit  you can thumbtack into the middle of a pencil  and you can lay out wire on the page  too  and get electrical current to run through it. And so you can kind of hack a pencil  just by thumbtacking into it with a little piano electrical circuit. And the electricity runs through your body too. And then you can take the little piano circuit off the pencil. You can make one of these brushes just on the fly. All you do is connect to the bristles  and the bristles are wet  so they conduct  and the person's body conducts  and leather is great to paint on  and then you can start hooking to everything  even the kitchen sink. The metal in the sink is conductive. Flowing water acts like a theremin or a violin. And you can even hook to the trees. Anything in the world is either conductive or not conductive  and you can use those together. So    Laughter    I took this to those same teens  because those teens are really awesome  and they'll try things that I won't try. I don't even have access to a facial piercing if I wanted to. And this young woman  she made what she called a hula looper  and as the hula hoop traveled around her body  she has a circuit taped to her shirt right there. You can see her pointing to it in the picture. And every time the hula hoop would smush against her body  it would connect two little pieces of copper tape  and it would make a sound  and the next sound  and it would loop the same sounds over and over again. I ran these workshops everywhere. In Taiwan  at an art museum  this    year old girl made a mushroom organ out of some mushrooms that were from Taiwan and some electrical tape and hot glue. And professional designers were making artifacts with this thing strapped onto it. And big companies like Intel or smaller design firms like Ideo or startups like Bump  were inviting me to give workshops  just to practice this idea of smashing electronics and everyday objects together. And then we came up with this idea to not just use electronics  but let's just smash computers with everyday objects and see how that goes over. And so I just want to do a quick demo. So this is the MaKey MaKey circuit  and I'm just going to set it up from the beginning in front of you. So I'll just plug it in  and now it's on by USB. And I'll just hook up the forward arrow. You guys are facing that way  so I'll hook it to this one. And I'll just hook up a little ground wire to it. And now  if I touch this piece of pizza  the slides that I showed you before should go forward. And now if I hook up this wire just by connecting it to the left arrow  I'm kind of programming it by where I hook it up  now I have a left arrow and a right arrow  so I should be able to go forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards. Awesome. And so we're like   We gotta put a video out about this.  Because no one really believed that this was important or meaningful except me and  like  one other guy. So we made a video to prove that there's lots of stuff you can do. You can kind of sketch with Play Doh and just Google for game controllers. Just ordinary Play Doh  nothing special. And you can literally draw joysticks and just find Pacman on your computer and then just hook it up.  Video game noises  And you know the little plastic drawers you can get at Target  Well  if you take those out  they hold water great  but you can totally cut your toes  so yeah  just be careful. You know the Happiness Project  where the experts are setting up the piano stairs  and how cool that is  Well  I think it's cool  but we should be doing that stuff ourselves. It shouldn't be a set of experts engineering the way the world works. We should all be participating in changing the way the world works together. Aluminum foil. Everybody has a cat. Get a bowl of water. This is just Photo Booth on your Mac OS. Hover the mouse over the  take a photo  button  and you've got a little cat photo booth. And so we needed hundreds of people to buy this. If hundreds of people didn't buy this  we couldn't put it on the market. And so we put it up on Kickstarter  and hundreds of people bought it in the first day. And then    days later         people had backed the project. And then what the best part is  we started getting a flood of videos in of people doing crazy things with it. So this is  The Star Spangled Banner  by eating lunch  including drinking Listerine. And we actually sent this guy materials. We're like   We're sponsoring you  man. You're  like  a pro maker.  Okay  just wait for this one. This is good. And these guys at the exploratorium are playing house plants as if they were drums. And dads and daughters are completing circuits in special ways. And then this brother    look at this diagram. See where it says  sister   I love when people put humans on the diagram. I always add humans to any technical    if you're drawing a technical diagram  put a human in it. And this kid is so sweet. He made this trampoline slideshow advancer for his sister so that on her birthday  she could be the star of the show  jumping on the trampoline to advance the slides. And this guy rounded up his dogs and he made a dog piano. And this is fun  and what could be more useful than feeling alive and fun  But it's also very serious because all this accessibility stuff started coming up  where people can't use computers  necessarily. Like this dad who wrote us  his son has cerebral palsy and he can't use a normal keyboard. And so his dad couldn't necessarily afford to buy all these custom controllers. And so  with the MaKey MaKey  he planned to make these gloves to allow him to navigate the web. And a huge eruption of discussion around accessibility came  and we're really excited about that. We didn't plan for that at all. And then all these professional musicians started using it  like at Coachella  just this weekend Jurassic   was using this onstage  and this D.J. is just from Brooklyn  right around here  and he put this up last month. And I love the carrot on the turntable. Most people cannot play them that way.  Laughter  And when this started to get serious  I thought  I'd better put a really serious warning label on the box that this comes in  because otherwise people are going to be getting this and they're going to be turning into agents of creative change  and governments will be crumbling  and I wouldn't have told people  so I thought I'd better warn them. And I also put this little surprise. When you open the lid of the box  it says   The world is a construction kit.  And as you start to mess around this way  I think that  in some small ways  you do start to see the landscape of your everyday life a little bit more like something you could express yourself with  and a little bit more like you could participate in designing the future of the way the world works. And so next time you're on an escalator and you drop an M M by accident  you know  maybe that's an M M surfboard  not an escalator  so don't pick it up right away. Maybe take some more stuff out of your pockets and throw it down  and maybe some chapstick  whatever. I used to want to design a utopian society or a perfect world or something like that. But as I'm kind of getting older and kind of messing with all this stuff  I'm realizing that my idea of a perfect world really can't be designed by one person or even by a million experts. It's really going to be seven billion pairs of hands  each following their own passions  and each kind of like a mosaic coming up and creating this world in their backyards and in their kitchens. And that's the world I really want to live in. Thank you. Okay  it's great to be back at TED. Why don't I just start by firing away with the video  Woman  This is it. We're on in two minutes. Man    Okay Glass  hang out with The Flying Club. Man    Google  photos of tiger heads.  Hmm. Man    You ready  You ready   Barking  Woman    Right there. Okay  Glass  take a picture. Man    Go  Man    Holy  beep   That is awesome. Child  Whoa  Look at that snake  Woman    Okay  Glass  record a video  Man    After this bridge  first exit. Man    Okay  A    right there  Man    Google  say  delicious  in Thai. Google Glass       Man    Mmm       . Woman    Google  jellyfish.  Man     It's beautiful. Sergey Brin  Oh  sorry  I just got this message from a Nigerian prince. He needs help getting    million dollars. I like to pay attention to these because that's how we originally funded the company  and it's gone pretty well. Though in all seriousness  this position that you just saw me in  looking down at my phone  that's one of the reasons behind this project  Project Glass. Because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life  how you want to connect to information. Should it be by just walking around looking down  But that was the vision behind Glass  and that's why we've created this form factor. Okay. And I don't want to go through all the things it does and whatnot  but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it. In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when you're out and about looking at your phone  it's kind of  is this what you're meant to do with your body  You're standing around there and you're just rubbing this featureless piece of glass. You're just kind of moving around. So when we developed Glass  we thought really about  can we make something that frees your hands  You saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there. They were all wearing Glass  and that's how we got that footage. And also you want something that frees your eyes. That's why we put the display up high  out of your line of sight  so it wouldn't be where you're looking and it wouldn't be where you're making eye contact with people. And also we wanted to free up the ears  so the sound actually goes through  conducts straight to the bones in your cranium  which is a little bit freaky at first  but you get used to it. And ironically  if you want to hear it better  you actually just cover your ear  which is kind of surprising  but that's how it works. My vision when we started Google    years ago was that eventually you wouldn't have to have a search query at all. You'd just have information come to you as you needed it. And this is now     years later  sort of the first form factor that I think can deliver that vision when you're out and about on the street talking to people and so forth. This project has lasted now  been just over two years. We've learned an amazing amount. It's been really important to make it comfortable. So our first prototypes we built were huge. It was like cell phones strapped to your head. It was very heavy  pretty uncomfortable. We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job  and then she almost ran away screaming. But we've come a long way. And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera. Our original prototypes didn't have cameras at all  but it's been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family  my kids. I just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment. And lastly I've realized  in experimenting with this device  that I also kind of have a nervous tic. The cell phone is    yeah  you have to look down on it and all that  but it's also kind of a nervous habit. Like if I smoked  I'd probably just smoke instead. I would just light up a cigarette. It would look cooler. You know  I'd be like    But in this case  you know  I whip this out and I sit there and look as if I have something very important to do or attend to. But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent just secluding away  be it email or social posts or whatnot  even though it wasn't really    there's nothing really that important or that pressing. And with this  I know I will get certain messages if I really need them  but I don't have to be checking them all the time. Yeah  I've really enjoyed actually exploring the world more  doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video. Thank you all very much. There's something that I'd like you to see. millions in China  footage of a two year old girl hit by a van and left bleeding in the street by passersby  footage too graphic to be shown. The entire accident is caught on camera. The driver pauses after hitting the child  his back wheels seen resting on her for over a second. Within two minutes  three people pass two year old Wang Yue by. The first walks around the badly injured toddler completely. Others look at her before moving off. Peter Singer  There were other people who walked past Wang Yue  and a second van ran over her legs before a street cleaner raised the alarm. She was rushed to hospital  but it was too late. She died. I wonder how many of you  looking at that  said to yourselves just now   I would not have done that. I would have stopped to help.  Raise your hands if that thought occurred to you. As I thought  that's most of you. And I believe you. I'm sure you're right. But before you give yourself too much credit  look at this. UNICEF reports that in        .  million children under five died from preventable  poverty related diseases. UNICEF thinks that that's good news because the figure has been steadily coming down from    million in     . That is good. But still   .  million is        children dying every day. Does it really matter that we're not walking past them in the street  Does it really matter that they're far away  I don't think it does make a morally relevant difference. The fact that they're not right in front of us  the fact  of course  that they're of a different nationality or race  none of that seems morally relevant to me. What is really important is  can we reduce that death toll  Can we save some of those        children dying every day  And the answer is  yes we can. Each of us spends money on things that we do not really need. You can think what your own habit is  whether it's a new car  a vacation or just something like buying bottled water when the water that comes out of the tap is perfectly safe to drink. You could take the money you're spending on those unnecessary things and give it to this organization  the Against Malaria Foundation  which would take the money you had given and use it to buy nets like this one to protect children like this one  and we know reliably that if we provide nets  they're used  and they reduce the number of children dying from malaria  just one of the many preventable diseases that are responsible for some of those        children dying every day. Fortunately  more and more people are understanding this idea  and the result is a growing movement  effective altruism. It's important because it combines both the heart and the head. The heart  of course  you felt. You felt the empathy for that child. But it's really important to use the head as well to make sure that what you do is effective and well directed  and not only that  but also I think reason helps us to understand that other people  wherever they are  are like us  that they can suffer as we can  that parents grieve for the deaths of their children  as we do  and that just as our lives and our well being matter to us  it matters just as much to all of these people. So I think reason is not just some neutral tool to help you get whatever you want. It does help us to put perspective on our situation. And I think that's why many of the most significant people in effective altruism have been people who have had backgrounds in philosophy or economics or math. And that might seem surprising  because a lot of people think   Philosophy is remote from the real world  economics  we're told  just makes us more selfish  and we know that math is for nerds.  But in fact it does make a difference  and in fact there's one particular nerd who has been a particularly effective altruist because he got this. This is the website of the Bill   Melinda Gates Foundation  and if you look at the words on the top right hand side  it says   All lives have equal value.  That's the understanding  the rational understanding of our situation in the world that has led to these people being the most effective altruists in history  Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett. No one  not Andrew Carnegie  not John D. Rockefeller  has ever given as much to charity as each one of these three  and they have used their intelligence to make sure that it is highly effective. According to one estimate  the Gates Foundation has already saved  .  million lives and many millions more  people  getting diseases that would have made them very sick  even if eventually they survived. Over the coming years  undoubtably the Gates Foundation is going to give a lot more  is going to save a lot more lives. Well  you might say  that's fine if you're a billionaire  you can have that kind of impact. But if I'm not  what can I do  So I'm going to look at four questions that people ask that maybe stand in the way of them giving. They worry how much of a difference they can make. But you don't have to be a billionaire. This is Toby Ord. He's a research fellow in philosophy at the University of Oxford. He became an effective altruist when he calculated that with the money that he was likely to earn throughout his career  an academic career  he could give enough to cure        people of blindness in developing countries and still have enough left for a perfectly adequate standard of living. So Toby founded an organization called Giving What We Can to spread this information  to unite people who want to share some of their income  and to ask people to pledge to give    percent of what they earn over their lifetime to fighting global poverty. Toby himself does better than that. He's pledged to live on        pounds a year    that's less than        dollars    and to give the rest to those organizations. And yes  Toby is married and he does have a mortgage. This is a couple at a later stage of life  Charlie Bresler and Diana Schott  who  when they were young  when they met  were activists against the Vietnam War  fought for social justice  and then moved into careers  as most people do  didn't really do anything very active about those values  although they didn't abandon them. And then  as they got to the age at which many people start to think of retirement  they returned to them  and they've decided to cut back on their spending  to live modestly  and to give both money and time to helping to fight global poverty. Now  mentioning time might lead you to think   Well  should I abandon my career and put all of my time into saving some of these        lives that are lost every day   One person who's thought quite a bit about this issue of how you can have a career that will have the biggest impact for good in the world is Will Crouch. He's a graduate student in philosophy  and he's set up a website called        Hours  the number of hours he estimates most people spend on their career  to advise people on how to have the best  most effective career. But you might be surprised to know that one of the careers that he encourages people to consider  if they have the right abilities and character  is to go into banking or finance. Why  Because if you earn a lot of money  you can give away a lot of money  and if you're successful in that career  you could give enough to an aid organization so that it could employ  let's say  five aid workers in developing countries  and each one of them would probably do about as much good as you would have done. So you can quintuple the impact by leading that kind of career. Here's one young man who's taken this advice. His name is Matt Weiger. He was a student at Princeton in philosophy and math  actually won the prize for the best undergraduate philosophy thesis last year when he graduated. But he's gone into finance in New York. He's already earning enough so that he's giving a six figure sum to effective charities and still leaving himself with enough to live on. Matt has also helped me to set up an organization that I'm working with that has the name taken from the title of a book I wrote   The Life You Can Save   which is trying to change our culture so that more people think that if we're going to live an ethical life  it's not enough just to follow the thou shalt nots and not cheat  steal  maim  kill  but that if we have enough  we have to share some of that with people who have so little. And the organization draws together people of different generations  like Holly Morgan  who's an undergraduate  who's pledged to give    percent of the little amount that she has  and on the right  Ada Wan  who has worked directly for the poor  but has now gone to Yale to do an MBA to have more to give. Many people will think  though  that charities aren't really all that effective. So let's talk about effectiveness. Toby Ord is very concerned about this  and he's calculated that some charities are hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than others  so it's very important to find the effective ones. Take  for example  providing a guide dog for a blind person. That's a good thing to do  right  Well  right  it is a good thing to do  but you have to think what else you could do with the resources. It costs about        dollars to train a guide dog and train the recipient so that the guide dog can be an effective help to a blind person. It costs somewhere between    and    dollars to cure a blind person in a developing country if they have trachoma. So you do the sums  and you get something like that. You could provide one guide dog for one blind American  or you could cure between     and       people of blindness. I think it's clear what's the better thing to do. But if you want to look for effective charities  this is a good website to go to. GiveWell exists to really assess the impact of charities  not just whether they're well run  and it's screened hundreds of charities and currently is recommending only three  of which the Against Malaria Foundation is number one. So it's very tough. If you want to look for other recommendations  thelifeyoucansave.com and Giving What We Can both have a somewhat broader list  but you can find effective organizations  and not just in the area of saving lives from the poor. I'm pleased to say that there is now also a website looking at effective animal organizations. That's another cause that I've been concerned about all my life  the immense amount of suffering that humans inflict on literally tens of billions of animals every year. So if you want to look for effective organizations to reduce that suffering  you can go to Effective Animal Activism. And some effective altruists think it's very important to make sure that our species survives at all. So they're looking at ways to reduce the risk of extinction. Here's one risk of extinction that we all became aware of recently  when an asteroid passed close to our planet. Possibly research could help us not only to predict the path of asteroids that might collide with us  but actually to deflect them. So some people think that would be a good thing to give to. There's many possibilities. My final question is  some people will think it's a burden to give. I don't really believe it is. I've enjoyed giving all of my life since I was a graduate student. It's been something fulfilling to me. Charlie Bresler said to me that he's not an altruist. He thinks that the life he's saving is his own. And Holly Morgan told me that she used to battle depression until she got involved with effective altruism  and now is one of the happiest people she knows. I think one of the reasons for this is that being an effective altruist helps to overcome what I call the Sisyphus problem. Here's Sisyphus as portrayed by Titian  condemned by the gods to push a huge boulder up to the top of the hill. Just as he gets there  the effort becomes too much  the boulder escapes  rolls all the way down the hill  he has to trudge back down to push it up again  and the same thing happens again and again for all eternity. Does that remind you of a consumer lifestyle  where you work hard to get money  you spend that money on consumer goods which you hope you'll enjoy using  But then the money's gone  you have to work hard to get more  spend more  and to maintain the same level of happiness  it's kind of a hedonic treadmill. You never get off  and you never really feel satisfied. Becoming an effective altruist gives you that meaning and fulfillment. It enables you to have a solid basis for self esteem on which you can feel your life was really worth living. I'm going to conclude by telling you about an email that I received while I was writing this talk just a month or so ago. It's from a man named Chris Croy  who I'd never heard of. This is a picture of him showing him recovering from surgery. Why was he recovering from surgery  The email began   Last Tuesday  I anonymously donated my right kidney to a stranger. That started a kidney chain which enabled four people to receive kidneys.  There's about     people each year in the U.S. and more in other countries who do that. I was pleased to read it. Chris went on to say that he'd been influenced by my writings in what he did. Well  I have to admit  I'm also somewhat embarrassed by that  because I still have two kidneys. But Chris went on to say that he didn't think that what he'd done was all that amazing  because he calculated that the number of life years that he had added to people  the extension of life  was about the same that you could achieve if you gave       dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation. And that did make me feel a little bit better  because I have given more than       dollars to the Against Malaria Foundation and to various other effective charities. So if you're feeling bad because you still have two kidneys as well  there's a way for you to get off the hook. Thank you. So  when I was in art school  I developed a shake in my hand  and this was the straightest line I could draw. Now in hindsight  it was actually good for some things  like mixing a can of paint or shaking a Polaroid  but at the time this was really doomsday. This was the destruction of my dream of becoming an artist. The shake developed out of  really  a single minded pursuit of pointillism  just years of making tiny  tiny dots. And eventually these dots went from being perfectly round to looking more like tadpoles  because of the shake. So to compensate  I'd hold the pen tighter  and this progressively made the shake worse  so I'd hold the pen tighter still. And this became a vicious cycle that ended up causing so much pain and joint issues  I had trouble holding anything. And after spending all my life wanting to do art  I left art school  and then I left art completely. But after a few years  I just couldn't stay away from art  and I decided to go to a neurologist about the shake and discovered I had permanent nerve damage. And he actually took one look at my squiggly line  and said   Well  why don't you just embrace the shake   So I did. I went home  I grabbed a pencil  and I just started letting my hand shake and shake. I was making all these scribble pictures. And even though it wasn't the kind of art that I was ultimately passionate about  it felt great. And more importantly  once I embraced the shake  I realized I could still make art. I just had to find a different approach to making the art that I wanted. Now  I still enjoyed the fragmentation of pointillism  seeing these little tiny dots come together to make this unified whole. So I began experimenting with other ways to fragment images where the shake wouldn't affect the work  like dipping my feet in paint and walking on a canvas  or  in a  D structure consisting of two by fours  creating a  D image by burning it with a blowtorch. I discovered that  if I worked on a larger scale and with bigger materials  my hand really wouldn't hurt  and after having gone from a single approach to art  I ended up having an approach to creativity that completely changed my artistic horizons. This was the first time I'd encountered this idea that embracing a limitation could actually drive creativity. At the time  I was finishing up school  and I was so excited to get a real job and finally afford new art supplies. I had this horrible little set of tools  and I felt like I could do so much more with the supplies I thought an artist was supposed to have. I actually didn't even have a regular pair of scissors. I was using these metal shears until I stole a pair from the office that I worked at. So I got out of school  I got a job  I got a paycheck  I got myself to the art store  and I just went nuts buying supplies. And then when I got home  I sat down and I set myself to task to really try to create something just completely outside of the box. But I sat there for hours  and nothing came to mind. The same thing the next day  and then the next  quickly slipping into a creative slump. And I was in a dark place for a long time  unable to create. And it didn't make any sense  because I was finally able to support my art  and yet I was creatively blank. But as I searched around in the darkness  I realized I was actually paralyzed by all of the choices that I never had before. And it was then that I thought back to my jittery hands. Embrace the shake. And I realized  if I ever wanted my creativity back  I had to quit trying so hard to think outside of the box and get back into it. I wondered  could you become more creative  then  by looking for limitations  What if I could only create with a dollar's worth of supplies  At this point  I was spending a lot of my evenings in    well  I guess I still spend a lot of my evenings in Starbucks   but I know you can ask for an extra cup if you want one  so I decided to ask for   . Surprisingly  they just handed them right over  and then with some pencils I already had  I made this project for only    cents. It really became a moment of clarification for me that we need to first be limited in order to become limitless. I took this approach of thinking inside the box to my canvas  and wondered what if  instead of painting on a canvas  I could only paint on my chest  So I painted    images  one layer at a time  one on top of another  with each picture representing an influence in my life. Or what if  instead of painting with a brush  I could only paint with karate chops   Laughter  So I'd dip my hands in paint  and I just attacked the canvas  and I actually hit so hard that I bruised a joint in my pinkie and it was stuck straight for a couple of weeks. Or  what if instead of relying on myself  I had to rely on other people to create the content for the art  So for six days  I lived in front of a webcam. I slept on the floor and I ate takeout  and I asked people to call me and share a story with me about a life changing moment. Their stories became the art as I wrote them onto the revolving canvas. Or what if instead of making art to display  I had to destroy it  This seemed like the ultimate limitation  being an artist without art. This destruction idea turned into a yearlong project that I called Goodbye Art  where each and every piece of art had to be destroyed after its creation. In the beginning of Goodbye Art  I focused on forced destruction  like this image of Jimi Hendrix  made with over       matches. Then I opened it up to creating art that was destroyed naturally. I looked for temporary materials  like spitting out food    sidewalk chalk and even frozen wine. The last iteration of destruction was to try to produce something that didn't actually exist in the first place. So I organized candles on a table  I lit them  and then blew them out  then repeated this process over and over with the same set of candles  then assembled the videos into the larger image. So the end image was never visible as a physical whole. It was destroyed before it ever existed. In the course of this Goodbye Art series  I created    different pieces with nothing left to physically display. What I thought would be the ultimate limitation actually turned out to be the ultimate liberation  as each time I created  the destruction brought me back to a neutral place where I felt refreshed and ready to start the next project. It did not happen overnight. There were times when my projects failed to get off the ground  or  even worse  after spending tons of time on them the end image was kind of embarrassing. But having committed to the process  I continued on  and something really surprising came out of this. As I destroyed each project  I was learning to let go  let go of outcomes  let go of failures  and let go of imperfections. And in return  I found a process of creating art that's perpetual and unencumbered by results. I found myself in a state of constant creation  thinking only of what's next and coming up with more ideas than ever. When I think back to my three years away from art  away from my dream  just going through the motions  instead of trying to find a different way to continue that dream  I just quit  I gave up. And what if I didn't embrace the shake  Because embracing the shake for me wasn't just about art and having art skills. It turned out to be about life  and having life skills. Because ultimately  most of what we do takes place here  inside the box  with limited resources. Learning to be creative within the confines of our limitations is the best hope we have to transform ourselves and  collectively  transform our world. Looking at limitations as a source of creativity changed the course of my life. Now  when I run into a barrier or I find myself creatively stumped  I sometimes still struggle  but I continue to show up for the process and try to remind myself of the possibilities  like using hundreds of real  live worms to make an image  using a pushpin to tattoo a banana  or painting a picture with hamburger grease. One of my most recent endeavors is to try to translate the habits of creativity that I've learned into something others can replicate. Limitations may be the most unlikely of places to harness creativity  but perhaps one of the best ways to get ourselves out of ruts  rethink categories and challenge accepted norms. And instead of telling each other to seize the day  maybe we can remind ourselves every day to seize the limitation. Thank you. What would be a good end of life  And I'm talking about the very end. I'm talking about dying. We all think a lot about how to live well. I'd like to talk about increasing our chances of dying well. I'm not a geriatrician. I design reading programs for preschoolers. What I know about this topic comes from a qualitative study with a sample size of two. In the last few years  I helped two friends have the end of life they wanted. Jim and Shirley Modini spent their    years of marriage living off the grid on their       acre ranch in the mountains of Sonoma County. They kept just enough livestock to make ends meet so that the majority of their ranch would remain a refuge for the bears and lions and so many other things that lived there. This was their dream. I met Jim and Shirley in their   s. They were both only children who chose not to have kids. As we became friends  I became their trustee and their medical advocate  but more importantly  I became the person who managed their end of life experiences. And we learned a few things about how to have a good end. In their final years  Jim and Shirley faced cancers  fractures  infections  neurological illness. It's true. At the end  our bodily functions and independence are declining to zero. What we found is that  with a plan and the right people  quality of life can remain high. The beginning of the end is triggered by a mortality awareness event  and during this time  Jim and Shirley chose ACR nature preserves to take their ranch over when they were gone. This gave them the peace of mind to move forward. It might be a diagnosis. It might be your intuition. But one day  you're going to say   This thing is going to get me.  Jim and Shirley spent this time letting friends know that their end was near and that they were okay with that. Dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness are different. In both cases  last days are about quiet reassurance. Jim died first. He was conscious until the very end  but on his last day he couldn't talk. Through his eyes  we knew when he needed to hear again   It is all set  Jim. We're going to take care of Shirley right here at the ranch  and ACR's going to take care of your wildlife forever.  From this experience I'm going to share five practices. I've put worksheets online  so if you'd like  you can plan your own end. It starts with a plan. Most people say   I'd like to die at home.  Eighty percent of Americans die in a hospital or a nursing home. Saying we'd like to die at home is not a plan. A lot of people say   If I get like that  just shoot me.  This is not a plan either  this is illegal. A plan involves answering straightforward questions about the end you want. Where do you want to be when you're no longer independent  What do you want in terms of medical intervention  And who's going to make sure your plan is followed  You will need advocates. Having more than one increases your chance of getting the end you want. Don't assume the natural choice is your spouse or child. You want someone who has the time and proximity to do this job well  and you want someone who can work with people under the pressure of an ever changing situation. Hospital readiness is critical. You are likely to be headed to the emergency room  and you want to get this right. Prepare a one page summary of your medical history  medications and physician information. Put this in a really bright envelope with copies of your insurance cards  your power of attorney  and your do not resuscitate order. Have advocates keep a set in their car. Tape a set to your refrigerator. When you show up in the E.R. with this packet  your admission is streamlined in a material way. You're going to need caregivers. You'll need to assess your personality and financial situation to determine whether an elder care community or staying at home is your best choice. In either case  do not settle. We went through a number of not quite right caregivers before we found the perfect team led by Marsha  who won't let you win at bingo just because you're dying but will go out and take videos of your ranch for you when you can't get out there  and Caitlin  who won't let you skip your morning exercises but knows when you need to hear that your wife is in good hands. Finally  last words. What do you want to hear at the very end  and from whom would you like to hear it  In my experience  you'll want to hear that whatever you're worried about is going to be fine. When you believe it's okay to let go  you will. So  this is a topic that normally inspires fear and denial. What I've learned is if we put some time into planning our end of life  we have the best chance of maintaining our quality of life. Here are Jim and Shirley just after deciding who would take care of their ranch. Here's Jim just a few weeks before he died  celebrating a birthday he didn't expect to see. And here's Shirley just a few days before she died being read an article in that day's paper about the significance of the wildlife refuge at the Modini ranch. Jim and Shirley had a good end of life  and by sharing their story with you  I hope to increase our chances of doing the same. Thank you. When we use the word  architect  or  designer   what we usually mean is a professional  someone who gets paid  and we tend to assume that it's those professionals who are going to be the ones to help us solve the really big  systemic design challenges that we face like climate change  urbanization and social inequality. That's our kind of working presumption. And I think it's wrong  actually. In       I was just about to graduate from architecture school after several years  and go out and get a job  and this happened. The economy ran out of jobs. And a couple of things struck me about this. One  don't listen to career advisers. And two  actually this is a fascinating paradox for architecture  which is that  as a society  we've never needed design thinking more  and yet architecture was literally becoming unemployed. It strikes me that we talk very deeply about design  but actually there's an economics behind architecture that we don't talk about  and I think we need to. And a good place to start is your own paycheck. So  as a bottom of the rung architecture graduate  I might expect to earn about        pounds. That's about                dollars. Now in terms of the whole world's population  that already puts me in the top  .   richest people  which raises the question of  who is it I'm working for  The uncomfortable fact is that actually almost everything that we call architecture today is actually the business of designing for about the richest one percent of the world's population  and it always has been. The reason why we forgot that is because the times in history when architecture did the most to transform society were those times when  actually  the one percent would build on behalf of the    percent  for various different reasons  whether that was through philanthropy in the   th century  communism in the early   th  the welfare state  and most recently  of course  through this inflated real estate bubble. And all of those booms  in their own various ways  have now kicked the bucket  and we're back in this situation where the smartest designers and architects in the world are only really able to work for one percent of the population. Now it's not just that that's bad for democracy  though I think it probably is  it's actually not a very clever business strategy  actually. I think the challenge facing the next generation of architects is  how are we going to turn our client from the one percent to the     percent  And I want to offer three slightly counterintuitive ideas for how it might be done. The first is  I think we need to question this idea that architecture is about making buildings. Actually  a building is about the most expensive solution you can think of to almost any given problem. And fundamentally  design should be much  much more interested in solving problems and creating new conditions. So here's a story. The office was working with a school  and they had an old Victorian school building. And they said to the architects   Look  our corridors are an absolute nightmare. They're far too small. They get congested between classes. There's bullying. We can't control them. So what we want you to do is re plan our entire building  and we know it's going to cost several million pounds  but we're reconciled to the fact.  And the team thought about this  and they went away  and they said   Actually  don't do that. Instead  get rid of the school bell. And instead of having one school bell that goes off once  have several smaller school bells that go off in different places and different times  distribute the traffic through the corridors.  It solves the same problem  but instead of spending several million pounds  you spend several hundred pounds. Now  it looks like you're doing yourself out of a job  but you're not. You're actually making yourself more useful. Architects are actually really  really good at this kind of resourceful  strategic thinking. And the problem is that  like a lot of design professions  we got fixated on the idea of providing a particular kind of consumer product  and I don't think that needs to be the case anymore. The second idea worth questioning is this   th century thing that mass architecture is about big    big buildings and big finance. Actually  we've got ourselves locked into this Industrial Era mindset which says that the only people who can make cities are large organizations or corporations who build on our behalf  procuring whole neighborhoods in single  monolithic projects  and of course  form follows finance. So what you end up with are single  monolithic neighborhoods based on this kind of one size fits all model. And a lot of people can't even afford them. But what if  actually  it's possible now for cities to be made not just by the few with a lot but also by the many with a bit  And when they do  they bring with them a completely different set of values about the place that they want to live. And it raises really interesting questions about  how will we plan cities  How will finance development  How will we sell design services  What would it mean for democratic societies to offer their citizens a right to build  And in a way it should be kind of obvious  right  that in the   st century  maybe cities can be developed by citizens. And thirdly  we need to remember that  from a strictly economic point of view  design shares a category with sex and care of the elderly    mostly it's done by amateurs. And that's a good thing. Most of the work takes place outside of the monetary economy in what's called the social economy or the core economy  which is people doing it for themselves. And the problem is that  up until now  it was the monetary economy which had all the infrastructure and all the tools. So the challenge we face is  how are we going to build the tools  the infrastructure and the institutions for architecture's social economy  And that began with open source software. And over the last few years  it's been moving into the physical world with open source hardware  which are freely shared blueprints that anyone can download and make for themselves. And that's where  D printing gets really  really interesting. Right  When suddenly you had a  D printer that was open source  the parts for which could be made on another  D printer. Or the same idea here  which is for a CNC machine  which is like a large printer that can cut sheets of plywood. What these technologies are doing is radically lowering the thresholds of time and cost and skill. They're challenging the idea that if you want something to be affordable it's got to be one size fits all. And they're distributing massively really complex manufacturing capabilities. We're moving into this future where the factory is everywhere  and increasingly that means that the design team is everyone. That really is an industrial revolution. And when we think that the major ideological conflicts that we inherited were all based around this question of who should control the means of production  and these technologies are coming back with a solution  actually  maybe no one. All of us. And we were fascinated by what that might mean for architecture. So about a year and a half ago  we started working on a project called WikiHouse  and WikiHouse is an open source construction system. And the idea is to make it possible for anyone to go online  access a freely shared library of  D models which they can download and adapt in  at the moment  SketchUp  because it's free  and it's easy to use  and almost at the click of a switch they can generate a set of cutting files which allow them  in effect  to print out the parts from a house using a CNC machine and a standard sheet material like plywood. And the parts are all numbered  and basically what you end up with is a really big IKEA kit. And it goes together without any bolts. It uses wedge and peg connections. And even the mallets to make it can be provided on the cutting sheets as well. And a team of about two or three people  working together  can build this. They don't need any traditional construction skills. They don't need a huge array of power tools or anything like that  and they can build a small house of about this size in about a day. And what you end up with is just the basic chassis of a house onto which you can then apply systems like windows and cladding and insulation and services based on what's cheap and what's available. Of course  the house is never finished. We're shifting our heads here  so the house is not a finished product. With the CNC machine  you can make new parts for it over its life or even use it to make the house next door. So we can begin to see the seed of a completely open source  citizen led urban development model  potentially. And we and others have built a few prototypes around the world now  and some really interesting lessons here. One of them is that it's always incredibly sociable. People get confused between construction work and having fun. But the principles of openness go right down into the really mundane  physical details. Like  never designing a piece that can't be lifted up. Or  when you're designing a piece  make sure you either can't put it in the wrong way round  or  if you do  it doesn't matter  because it's symmetrical. Probably the principal which runs deepest with us is the principal set out by Linus Torvalds  the open source pioneer  which was that idea of   Be lazy like a fox.  Don't reinvent the wheel every time. Take what already works  and adapt it for your own needs. Contrary to almost everything that you might get taught at an architecture school  copying is good. Which is appropriate  because actually  this approach is not innovative. It's actually how we built buildings for hundreds of years before the Industrial Revolution in these sorts of community barn raisings. The only difference between traditional vernacular architecture and open source architecture might be a web connection  but it's a really  really big difference. We shared the whole of WikiHouse under a Creative Commons license  and now what's just beginning to happen is that groups around the world are beginning to take it and use it and hack it and tinker with it  and it's amazing. There's a cool group over in Christchurch in New Zealand looking at post earthquake development housing  and thanks to the TED city Prize  we're working with an awesome group in one of Rio's favelas to set up a kind of community factory and micro university. These are very  very small beginnings  and actually there's more people in the last week who have got in touch and they're not even on this map. I hope next time you see it  you won't even be able to see the map. We're aware that WikiHouse is a very  very small answer  but it's a small answer to a really  really big question  which is that globally  right now  the fastest growing cities are not skyscraper cities. They're self made cities in one form or another. If we're talking about the   st century city  these are the guys who are going to be making it. You know  like it or not  welcome to the world's biggest design team. So if we're serious about problems like climate change  urbanization and health  actually  our existing development models aren't going to do it. As I think Robert Neuwirth said  there isn't a bank or a corporation or a government or an NGO who's going to be able to do it if we treat citizens only as consumers. How extraordinary would it be  though  if collectively we were to develop solutions not just to the problem of structure that we've been working on  but to infrastructure problems like solar powered air conditioning  off grid energy  off grid sanitation    low cost  open source  high performance solutions that anyone can very  very easily make  and to put them all into a commons where they're owned by everyone and they're accessible by everyone  A kind of Wikipedia for stuff  And once something's in the commons  it will always be there. How much would that change the rules  And I think the technology's on our side. If design's great project in the   th century was the democratization of consumption    that was Henry Ford  Levittown  Coca Cola  IKEA   I think design's great project in the   st century is the democratization of production. And when it comes to architecture in cities  that really matters. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hi  everybody. Ban gap seum ni da. I'd like to share with you a little bit of me playing my life. I might look successful and happy being in front of you today  but I once suffered from severe depression and was in total despair. The violin  which meant everything to me  became a grave burden on me. Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me  their words sounded like meaningless noise. When I was just about to give everything up after years of suffering  I started to rediscover the true power of music. In the midst of hardship  it was the music that gave me    that restored my soul. The comfort the music gave me was just indescribable  and it was a real eye opening experience for me too  and it totally changed my perspective on life and set me free from the pressure of becoming a successful violinist. Do you feel like you are all alone  I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart  as it did for me. Thank you. Now  I use my music to reach people's hearts and have found there are no boundaries. My audience is anyone who is here to listen  even those who are not familiar with classical music. I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center  but also hospitals  churches  prisons  and restricted facilities for leprosy patients  just to mention a few. Now  with my last piece  I'd like to show you that classical music can be so much fun  exciting  and that it can rock you. Let me introduce you to my brand new project   Baroque in Rock   which became a golden disc most recently. It's such an honor for me. I think  while I'm enjoying my life as a happy musician  I'm earning a lot more recognition than I've ever imagined. But it's now your turn. Changing your perspectives will not only transform you but also the whole world. Just play your life with all you have  and share it with the world. I really look forward to witnessing a transforming world by you  TEDsters. Play your life  and stay tuned. I'm almost like a crazy evangelical. I've always known that the age of design is upon us  almost like a rapture. If the day is sunny  I think   Oh  the gods have had a good design day.  Or  I go to a show and I see a beautiful piece by an artist  particularly beautiful  I say he's so good because he clearly looked to design to understand what he needed to do. So I really do believe that design is the highest form of creative expression. That's why I'm talking to you today about the age of design  and the age of design is the age in which design is still cute furniture  is still posters  is still fast cars  what you see at MoMA today. But in truth  what I really would like to explain to the public and to the audiences of MoMA is that the most interesting chairs are the ones that are actually made by a robot  like this beautiful chair by Dirk Vander Kooij  where a robot deposits a toothpaste like slur of recycled refrigerator parts  as if he were a big candy  and makes a chair out of it. Or good design is digital fonts that we use all the time and that become part of our identity. I want people to understand that design is so much more than cute chairs  that it is first and foremost everything that is around us in our life. And it's interesting how so much of what we're talking about tonight is not simply design but interaction design. And in fact  interaction design is what I've been trying to insert in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art for a few years  starting not very timidly but just pointedly with works  for instance  by Martin Wattenberg    the way a machine plays chess with itself  that you see here  or Lisa Strausfeld and her partners  the Sugar interface for One Laptop Per Child  Toshio Iwai's Tenori On musical instruments  and Philip Worthington's Shadow Monsters  and John Maeda's Reactive Books  and also Jonathan Harris and Sep Kamvar's I Want You To Want Me. These were some of the first acquisitions that really introduced the idea of interaction design to the public. But more recently  I've been trying really to go even deeper into interaction design with examples that are emotionally really suggestive and that really explain interaction design at a level that is almost undeniable. The Wind Map  by Wattenberg and Fernanda Vi gas  I don't know if you've ever seen it    it's really fantastic. It looks at the territory of the United States as if it were a wheat field that is procured by the winds and that is really giving you a pictorial image of what's going on with the winds in the United States. But also  more recently  we started acquiring video games  and that's where all hell broke loose in a really interesting way.  Laughter  There are still people that believe that there's a high and there's a low. And that's really what I find so intriguing about the reactions that we've had to the anointment of video games in the MoMA collection. We've    No  first of all  New York Magazine always gets it. I love them. So we are in the right quadrant. We are in the Highbrow    that's daring  that's courageous    and Brilliant  which is great. Timidly  we've been higher on the diagonal in other situations  but it's okay. It's good. It's good. It's good.  Laughter  But here comes the art critic. Oh  that was fantastic. So the first was Jonathan Jones from The Guardian.  Sorry  MoMA  video games are not art.  Did I ever say they were art  I was talking about interaction design. Excuse me.  Exhibiting Pac Man and Tetris alongside Picasso and Van Gogh     They're two floors away.  Laughter     will mean game over for any real understanding of art.  I'm bringing in the end of the world. You know  We were talking about the rapture  It's coming. And Jonathan Jones is making it happen. So the same Guardian rebuts   Are video games art  the debate that shouldn't be. Last week  Guardian art critic blah blah suggested that games cannot qualify as art. But is he right  And does it matter   Thank you. Does it matter  You know  it's like once again there's this whole problem of design being often misunderstood for art  or the idea that is so diffuse that designers want to aspire to  would like to be called  artists. No. Designers aspire to be really great designers. Thank you very much. And that's more than enough. So my knight in shining armor  John Maeda  without any prompt  came out with this big declaration on why video games belong in the MoMA. And that was fantastic. And I thought that was it. But then there was another wonderfully pretentious article that came out in The New Republic  so pretentious  by Liel Leibovitz  and it said   MoMA has mistaken video games for art.  Again.  The museum is putting Pac Man alongside Picasso.  Again.  That misses the point.  Excuse me. You're missing the point. And here  look  the above question is put bluntly   Are video games art  No. Video games aren't art because they are quite thoroughly something else  code.  Oh  so Picasso is not art because it's oil paint. Right  So it's so fantastic to see how these feathers that were ruffled  and these reactions  were so vehement. And you know what  The International Cat Video Film Festival didn't have that much of a reaction.  Laughter  I think this was truly fantastic. We were talking about dancing ponies  but I was really jealous of the Walker Arts Center for putting up this festival  because it's very  very wonderful. And there's this Flaubert quote that I love   I have always tried to live in an ivory tower  but a tide of shit is beating at its walls  threatening to undermine it.  I consider myself the tide of shit. You know  we have to go through that. Even in the     s  my colleagues that were trying to put together an abstract art show had all of these works stopped by the customs officers that decided they were not art. So it's happened before  and it will happen in the future  but right now I can tell you that I am so  so proud to be able to call Pac Man part of the MoMA collection. And the same with  for instance  Tetris  original version  the Soviet one. And you know  the amount of work    yeah  Alexey Pajitnov was working for the Soviet government and that's how he developed Tetris  and Alexey himself reconstructed the whole game and even gave us a simulation of the cathode ray tube that makes it look slightly bombed. And it's fantastic. So behind these acquisitions is an enormous amount of work  because we're still the Museum of Modern Art  so even when we tackle popular culture  we tackle it as a form of interaction design and as something that has to go into the collection at MoMA  therefore  has to be researched. So to get to choosing Eric Chahi's wonderful Another World  amongst others  we put together a panel of experts  and we worked on this acquisition  and it's mostly myself and Kate Carmody and Paul Galloway. We worked on it for a year and a half. So many people helped us   designers of games  you might know Jamin Warren and his collaborators at Kill Screen magazine  and you know  Kevin Slavin. You name it. We bugged everybody  because we knew that we were ignorant. We were not real gamers enough  so we had to really talk to them. And so we decided  of course  to have Sim City       not the other Sim City  that one in particular  so the criteria that we developed along the way were really strong  and were not only criteria of selection. They were also criteria of exhibition and of preservation. That's what makes this acquisition more than a little game or a little joke. It's truly a way to think of how to preserve and show artifacts that will more and more become part of our lives in the future. We live today  as you know very well  not in the digital  not in the physical  but in the kind of minestrone that our mind makes of the two. And that's really where interaction lies  and that's the importance of interaction. And in order to explain interaction  we need to really bring people in and make them realize how interaction is part of their lives. So when I talk about it  I don't talk only about video games  which are in a way the purest form of interaction  unadulterated by any kind of function or finality. I also talk about the MetroCard vending machine  which I consider a masterpiece of interaction. I mean  that interface is beautiful. It looks like a burly MTA guy coming out of the tunnel. You know  with your mitt you can actually paw the MetroCard  and I talk about how bad ATM machines usually are. So I let people understand that it's up to them to know how to judge interaction so as to know when it's good or when it's bad. So when I show The Sims  I try to make people really feel what it meant to have an interaction with The Sims  not only the fun but also the responsibility that came with the Tamagotchi. You know  video games can be truly deep even when they're completely mindless. I'm sure that all of you know Katamari Damacy. It's about rolling a ball and picking up as many objects as you can in a finite amount of time and hopefully you'll be able to make it into a planet. I've never made it into a planet  but that's it. Or  you know  Vib Ribbon was not distributed here in the United States. It was a PlayStation game  but mostly for Japan. And it was one of the first video games in which you could choose your own music. So you would put into the PlayStation  you would put your own CD  and then the game would change alongside your music. So really fantastic. Not to mention Eve Online. Eve Online is an artificial universe  if you wish  but one of the diplomats that was killed in Benghazi  not Ambassador Stevens  but one of his collaborators  was a really big shot in Eve Online  so here you have a diplomat in the real world that spends his time in Eve Online to kind of test  maybe  all of his ideas about diplomacy and about universe building  and to the point that the first announcement of the bombing was actually given on Eve Online  and after his death  several parts of the universe were named after him. And I was just recently at the Eve Online fan festival in Reykjav k that was quite amazing. I mean  we're talking about an experience that of course can seem weird to many  but that is very educational. Of course  there are games that are even more educational. Dwarf Fortress is like the holy grail of this kind of massive multiplayer online game  and in fact the two Adams brothers were in Reykjav k  and they were greeted by a standing ovation by all the Eve Online fans. It was amazing to see. And it's a beautiful game. So you start seeing here that the aesthetics that are so important to a museum collection like MoMA's are kept alive also by the selection of these games. And you know  Valve    you know  Portal    is an example of a video game in which you have a certain type of violence which also leads me to talk about one of the biggest issues that we had to discuss when we acquired the video games  what to do with violence. Right  We had to make decisions. At MoMA  interestingly  there's a lot of violence depicted in the art part of the collection  but when I came to MoMA    years ago  and as an Italian  I said   You know what  we need a Beretta.  And I was told   No. No guns in the design collection.  And I was like   Why   Interestingly  I learned that it's considered that in design and in the design collection  what you see is what you get. So when you see a gun  it's an instrument for killing in the design collection. If it's in the art collection  it might be a critique of the killing instrument. So it's very interesting. But we are acquiring our critical dimension also in design  so maybe one day we'll be able to acquire also the guns. But here  in this particular case  we decided  you know  with Kate and Paul  that we would have no gratuitous violence. So we have Portal because you shoot walls in order to create new spaces. We have Street Fighter II  because martial arts are good. But we don't have GTA because  maybe it's my own reflection  I've never been able to do anything but crashing cars and shooting prostitutes and pimps. So it was not very constructive.  Laughter  So  I'm making fun of it  but we discussed this for so many days. You have no idea. And to this day  I am ambivalent  but when you have instead games like Flow  there's no doubt. It's like  it's about serenity and it's about sublime. It's about experiencing what it means to be a sea creature. Then we have a few also side scrollers    classical ones. So it's quite a hefty collection. And right now  we started with the first     but we have several that are coming up  and the reason why we haven't acquired them yet is because you don't acquire just the game. You acquire the relationship with the company. What we want  what we aspire to  is the code. It's very hard to get  of course. But that's what would enable us to preserve the video games for a really long time  and that's what museums do. They also preserve artifacts for posterity. In absence of the code  because  you know  video game companies are not very forthcoming in some cases  in absence of that  we acquire the relationship with the company. We're going to stay with them forever. They're not going to get rid of us. And one day  we'll get that code.  Laughter  But I want to explain to you the criteria that we chose for interaction design. Aesthetics are really important. And I'm showing you Core War here  which is an early game that takes advantage aesthetically of the limitations of the processor. So the kind of interferences that you see here that look like beautiful barriers in the game are actually a consequence of the processor's limitedness  which is fantastic. So aesthetics is always important. And so is space  the spatial aspect of games. You know  I feel that the best video games are the ones that have really savvy architects that are behind them  and if they're not architects  bona fide trained in architecture  they have that feeling. But the spatial evolution in video games is extremely important. Time. The way we experience time in video games  as in other forms of interaction design  is really quite amazing. It can be real time or it can be the time within the game  as is in Animal Crossing  where seasons follow each other at their own pace. So time  space  aesthetics  and then  most important  behavior. The real core issue of interaction design is behavior. Designers that deal with interaction design behaviors that go to influence the rest of our lives. They're not just limited to our interaction with the screen. In this case  I'm showing you Marble Madness  which is a beautiful game in which the controller is a big sphere that vibrates with you  so you have a sphere that's moving in this landscape  and the sphere  the controller itself  gives you a sense of the movement. In a way  you can see how video games are the purest aspect of interaction design and are very useful to explain what interaction is. We don't want to show the video games with the paraphernalia. No arcade nostalgia. If anything  we want to show the code  and here you see Ben Fry's distellamap of Pac Man  of the Pac Man code. So the way we acquired the games is very interesting and very unorthodox. You see them here displayed alongside other examples of design  furniture and other parts  but there's no paraphernalia  no nostalagia  only the screen and a little shelf with the controllers. The controllers are  of course  part of the experience  so you cannot do away with it. But interestingly  this choice was not condemned too vehemently by gamers. I was afraid that they would kill us  and instead they understood  especially when I told them that I was trying to apply the same stratagem that Philip Johnson applied in      when he wanted to make people understand the importance of design  and he took propeller blades and pieces of machinery and in the MoMA galleries he put them on white pedestals against white walls  as if they were Brancusi sculptures. He created this strange distance  this shock  that made people realize how gorgeous formally  and also important functionally  design pieces were. I would like to do the same with video games. By getting rid of the sticky carpets and the cigarette butts and everything else that we might remember from our childhood  I want people to understand that those are important forms of design. And in a way  the video games  the fonts and everything else lead us to make people understand a wider meaning for design. One of my dream acquisitions  which has been on hold for a few years but now will come back on the front burner  is a    . I would like to acquire it  but without owning it. I don't want it to be at MoMA and possessed by MoMA. I want it to keep flying. So it's an acquisition where MoMA makes an arrangement with an airline and keeps the Boeing     flying. And the same with the     sign that we acquired a few years ago. It was the first example of an acquisition of something that is in the public domain. And what I say to people  it's almost as if a butterfly were flying by and we captured the shadow on the wall  and just we're showing the shadow. So in a way  we're showing a manifestation of something that is truly important and that is part of our identity but that nobody can have. And it's too long to explain the acquisition  but if you want to go on the MoMA blog  there's a long post where I explain why it's such a great example of design. Along the way  I've had to burn a few chairs. You know  I've had to do away with a few concepts of design past. But I see that people are coming along  that the audiences  paradoxically  are much more responsive and much more understanding of this expansion of design than some of my colleagues are. Design is truly everywhere  and design is as important as anything  and I'm so glad that  because of its diversity and because of its centrality to our lives  many more people are coming to it as a profession  as a passion  and as  very simply  part of their own culture. Thank you very much. I'm going to share with you a paradigm shifting perspective on the issues of gender violence    sexual assault  domestic violence  relationship abuse  sexual harassment  sexual abuse of children. That whole range of issues that I'll refer to in shorthand as  gender violence issues   they've been seen as women's issues that some good men help out with  but I have a problem with that frame and I don't accept it. I don't see these as women's issues that some good men help out with. In fact  I'm going to argue that these are men's issues  first and foremost. Now obviously  they're also women's issues  so I appreciate that  but calling gender violence a women's issue is part of the problem  for a number of reasons. The first is that it gives men an excuse not to pay attention. Right  A lot of men hear the term  women's issues  and we tend to tune it out  and we think   Hey  I'm a guy. That's for the girls   or  That's for the women.  And a lot of men literally don't get beyond the first sentence as a result. It's almost like a chip in our brain is activated  and the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction when we hear the term  women's issues.  This is also true  by the way  of the word  gender   because a lot of people hear the word  gender  and they think it means  women.  So they think that gender issues is synonymous with women's issues. There's some confusion about the term gender. And actually  let me illustrate that confusion by way of analogy. So let's talk for a moment about race. In the U.S.  when we hear the word  race   a lot of people think that means African American  Latino  Asian American  Native American  South Asian  Pacific Islander  on and on. A lot of people  when they hear the word  sexual orientation  think it means gay  lesbian  bisexual. And a lot of people  when they hear the word  gender   think it means women. In each case  the dominant group doesn't get paid attention to. Right  As if white people don't have some sort of racial identity or belong to some racial category or construct  as if heterosexual people don't have a sexual orientation  as if men don't have a gender. This is one of the ways that dominant systems maintain and reproduce themselves  which is to say the dominant group is rarely challenged to even think about its dominance  because that's one of the key characteristics of power and privilege  the ability to go unexamined  lacking introspection  in fact being rendered invisible in large measure in the discourse about issues that are primarily about us. And this is amazing how this works in domestic and sexual violence  how men have been largely erased from so much of the conversation about a subject that is centrally about men. And I'm going to illustrate what I'm talking about by using the old tech. I'm old school on some fundamental regards. I work with    I make films    and I work with high tech  but I'm still old school as an educator  and I want to share with you this exercise that illustrates on the sentence structure level how the way that we think  literally the way that we use language  conspires to keep our attention off of men. This is about domestic violence in particular  but you can plug in other analogues. This comes from the work of the feminist linguist Julia Penelope. It starts with a very basic English sentence   John beat Mary.  That's a good English sentence. John is the subject. Beat is the verb. Mary is the object. Good sentence. Now we're going to move to the second sentence  which says the same thing in the passive voice.  Mary was beaten by John.  And now a whole lot has happened in one sentence. We've gone from  John beat Mary  to  Mary was beaten by John.  We've shifted our focus in one sentence from John to Mary  and you can see John is very close to the end of the sentence  well  close to dropping off the map of our psychic plain. The third sentence  John is dropped  and we have   Mary was beaten   and now it's all about Mary. We're not even thinking about John. It's totally focused on Mary. Over the past generation  the term we've used synonymous with  beaten  is  battered   so we have  Mary was battered.  And the final sentence in this sequence  flowing from the others  is   Mary is a battered woman.  So now Mary's very identity    Mary is a battered woman    is what was done to her by John in the first instance. But we've demonstrated that John has long ago left the conversation. Now  those of us who work in the domestic and sexual violence field know that victim blaming is pervasive in this realm  which is to say  blaming the person to whom something was done rather than the person who did it. And we say things like  why do these women go out with these men  Why are they attracted to these men  Why do they keep going back  What was she wearing at that party  What a stupid thing to do. Why was she drinking with that group of guys in that hotel room  This is victim blaming  and there are numerous reasons for it  but one of them is that our whole cognitive structure is set up to blame victims. This is all unconscious. Our whole cognitive structure is set up to ask questions about women and women's choices and what they're doing  thinking  and wearing. And I'm not going to shout down people who ask questions about women  okay  It's a legitimate thing to ask. But's let's be clear  Asking questions about Mary is not going to get us anywhere in terms of preventing violence. We have to ask a different set of questions. You can see where I'm going with this  right  The questions are not about Mary. They're about John. The questions include things like  why does John beat Mary  Why is domestic violence still a big problem in the United States and all over the world  What's going on  Why do so many men abuse  physically  emotionally  verbally  and other ways  the women and girls  and the men and boys  that they claim to love  What's going on with men  Why do so many adult men sexually abuse little girls and little boys  Why is that a common problem in our society and all over the world today  Why do we hear over and over again about new scandals erupting in major institutions like the Catholic Church or the Penn State football program or the Boy Scouts of America  on and on and on  And then local communities all over the country and all over the world  right  We hear about it all the time. The sexual abuse of children. What's going on with men  Why do so many men rape women in our society and around the world  Why do so many men rape other men  What is going on with men  And then what is the role of the various institutions in our society that are helping to produce abusive men at pandemic rates  Because this isn't about individual perpetrators. That's a naive way to understanding what is a much deeper and more systematic social problem. You know  the perpetrators aren't these monsters who crawl out of the swamp and come into town and do their nasty business and then retreat into the darkness. That's a very naive notion  right  Perpetrators are much more normal than that  and everyday than that. So the question is  what are we doing here in our society and in the world  What are the roles of various institutions in helping to produce abusive men  What's the role of religious belief systems  the sports culture  the pornography culture  the family structure  economics  and how that intersects  and race and ethnicity and how that intersects  How does all this work  And then  once we start making those kinds of connections and asking those important and big questions  then we can talk about how we can be transformative  in other words  how can we do something differently  How can we change the practices  How can we change the socialization of boys and the definitions of manhood that lead to these current outcomes  These are the kind of questions that we need to be asking and the kind of work that we need to be doing  but if we're endlessly focused on what women are doing and thinking in relationships or elsewhere  we're not going to get to that piece. Now  I understand that a lot of women who have been trying to speaking out about these issues  today and yesterday and for years and years  often get shouted down for their efforts. They get called nasty names like  male basher  and  man hater   and the disgusting and offensive  feminazi.  Right  And you know what all this is about  It's called kill the messenger. It's because the women who are standing up and speaking out for themselves and for other women as well as for men and boys  it's a statement to them to sit down and shut up  keep the current system in place  because we don't like it when people rock the boat. We don't like it when people challenge our power. You'd better sit down and shut up  basically. And thank goodness that women haven't done that. Thank goodness that we live in a world where there's so much women's leadership that can counteract that. But one of the powerful roles that men can play in this work is that we can say some things that sometimes women can't say  or  better yet  we can be heard saying some things that women often can't be heard saying. Now  I appreciate that that's a problem. It's sexism. But it's the truth. And so one of the things that I say to men  and my colleagues and I always say this  is we need more men who have the courage and the strength to start standing up and saying some of this stuff  and standing with women and not against them and pretending that somehow this is a battle between the sexes and other kinds of nonsense. We live in the world together. And by the way  one of the things that really bothers me about some of the rhetoric against feminists and others who have built the battered women's and rape crisis movements around the world is that somehow  like I said  that they're anti male. What about all the boys who are profoundly affected in a negative way by what some adult man is doing against their mother  themselves  their sisters  What about all those boys  What about all the young men and boys who have been traumatized by adult men's violence  You know what  The same system that produces men who abuse women produces men who abuse other men. And if we want to talk about male victims  let's talk about male victims. Most male victims of violence are the victims of other men's violence. So that's something that both women and men have in common. We are both victims of men's violence. So we have it in our direct self interest  not to mention the fact that most men that I know have women and girls that we care deeply about  in our families and our friendship circles and every other way. So there's so many reasons why we need men to speak out. It seems obvious saying it out loud. Doesn't it  Now  the nature of the work that I do and my colleagues do in the sports culture and the U.S. military  in schools  we pioneered this approach called the bystander approach to gender violence prevention. And I just want to give you the highlights of the bystander approach  because it's a big thematic shift  although there's lots of particulars  but the heart of it is  instead of seeing men as perpetrators and women as victims  or women as perpetrators  men as victims  or any combination in there. I'm using the gender binary. I know there's more than men and women  there's more than male and female. And there are women who are perpetrators  and of course there are men who are victims. There's a whole spectrum. But instead of seeing it in the binary fashion  we focus on all of us as what we call bystanders  and a bystander is defined as anybody who is not a perpetrator or a victim in a given situation  so in other words friends  teammates  colleagues  coworkers  family members  those of us who are not directly involved in a dyad of abuse  but we are embedded in social  family  work  school  and other peer culture relationships with people who might be in that situation. What do we do  How do we speak up  How do we challenge our friends  How do we support our friends  But how do we not remain silent in the face of abuse  Now  when it comes to men and male culture  the goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge men who are. And when I say abusive  I don't mean just men who are beating women. We're not just saying a man whose friend is abusing his girlfriend needs to stop the guy at the moment of attack. That's a naive way of creating a social change. It's along a continuum  we're trying to get men to interrupt each other. So  for example  if you're a guy and you're in a group of guys playing poker  talking  hanging out  no women present  and another guy says something sexist or degrading or harassing about women  instead of laughing along or pretending you didn't hear it  we need men to say   Hey  that's not funny. You know  that could be my sister you're talking about  and could you joke about something else  Or could you talk about something else  I don't appreciate that kind of talk.  Just like if you're a white person and another white person makes a racist comment  you'd hope  I hope  that white people would interrupt that racist enactment by a fellow white person. Just like with heterosexism  if you're a heterosexual person and you yourself don't enact harassing or abusive behaviors towards people of varying sexual orientations  if you don't say something in the face of other heterosexual people doing that  then  in a sense  isn't your silence a form of consent and complicity  Well  the bystander approach is trying to give people tools to interrupt that process and to speak up and to create a peer culture climate where the abusive behavior will be seen as unacceptable  not just because it's illegal  but because it's wrong and unacceptable in the peer culture. And if we can get to the place where men who act out in sexist ways will lose status  young men and boys who act out in sexist and harassing ways towards girls and women  as well as towards other boys and men  will lose status as a result of it  guess what  We'll see a radical diminution of the abuse. Because the typical perpetrator is not sick and twisted. He's a normal guy in every other way. Isn't he  Now  among the many great things that Martin Luther King said in his short life was   In the end  what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends.  In the end  what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies but the silence of our friends. There's been an awful lot of silence in male culture about this ongoing tragedy of men's violence against women and children  hasn't there  There's been an awful lot of silence. And all I'm saying is that we need to break that silence  and we need more men to do that. Now  it's easier said than done  because I'm saying it now  but I'm telling you it's not easy in male culture for guys to challenge each other  which is one of the reasons why part of the paradigm shift that has to happen is not just understanding these issues as men's issues  but they're also leadership issues for men. Because ultimately  the responsibility for taking a stand on these issues should not fall on the shoulders of little boys or teenage boys in high school or college men. It should be on adult men with power. Adult men with power are the ones we need to be holding accountable for being leaders on these issues  because when somebody speaks up in a peer culture and challenges and interrupts  he or she is being a leader  really  right  But on a big scale  we need more adult men with power to start prioritizing these issues  and we haven't seen that yet  have we  Now  I was at a dinner a number of years ago  and I work extensively with the U.S. military  all the services. And I was at this dinner and this woman said to me    I think she thought she was a little clever    she said   So how long have you been doing sensitivity training with the Marines   And I said   With all due respect  I don't do sensitivity training with the Marines. I run a leadership program in the Marine Corps.  Now  I know it's a bit pompous  my response  but it's an important distinction  because I don't believe that what we need is sensitivity training. We need leadership training  because  for example  when a professional coach or a manager of a baseball team or a football team    and I work extensively in that realm as well    makes a sexist comment  makes a homophobic statement  makes a racist comment  there will be discussions on the sports blogs and in sports talk radio. And some people will say   Well  he needs sensitivity training.  And other people will say   Well get off it. You know  that's political correctness run amok  and he made a stupid statement. Move on.  My argument is  he doesn't need sensitivity training. He needs leadership training  because he's being a bad leader  because in a society with gender diversity and sexual diversity    and racial and ethnic diversity  you make those kind of comments  you're failing at your leadership. If we can make this point that I'm making to powerful men and women in our society at all levels of institutional authority and power  it's going to change  it's going to change the paradigm of people's thinking. You know  for example  I work a lot in college and university athletics throughout North America. We know so much about how to prevent domestic and sexual violence  right  There's no excuse for a college or university to not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training mandated for all student athletes  coaches  administrators  as part of their educational process. We know enough to know that we can easily do that. But you know what's missing  The leadership. But it's not the leadership of student athletes. It's the leadership of the athletic director  the president of the university  the people in charge who make decisions about resources and who make decisions about priorities in the institutional settings. That's a failure  in most cases  of men's leadership. Look at Penn State. Penn State is the mother of all teachable moments for the bystander approach. You had so many situations in that realm where men in powerful positions failed to act to protect children  in this case  boys. It's unbelievable  really. But when you get into it  you realize there are pressures on men. There are constraints within peer cultures on men  which is why we need to encourage men to break through those pressures. And one of the ways to do that is to say there's an awful lot of men who care deeply about these issues. I know this. I work with men  and I've been working with tens of thousands  hundreds of thousands of men for many  many decades now. It's scary  when you think about it  how many years. But there's so many men who care deeply about these issues  but caring deeply is not enough. We need more men with the guts  with the courage  with the strength  with the moral integrity to break our complicit silence and challenge each other and stand with women and not against them. By the way  we owe it to women. There's no question about it. But we also owe it to our sons. We also owe it to young men who are growing up all over the world in situations where they didn't make the choice to be a man in a culture that tells them that manhood is a certain way. They didn't make the choice. We that have a choice have an opportunity and a responsibility to them as well. I hope that  going forward  men and women  working together  can begin the change and the transformation that will happen so that future generations won't have the level of tragedy that we deal with on a daily basis. I know we can do it. We can do better. Thank you very much.  Applause  When I was a young boy  I used to gaze through the microscope of my father at the insects in amber that he kept in the house. And they were remarkably well preserved  morphologically just phenomenal. And we used to imagine that someday  they would actually come to life and they would crawl out of the resin  and  if they could  they would fly away. If you had asked me    years ago whether or not we would ever be able to sequence the genome of extinct animals  I would have told you  it's unlikely. If you had asked whether or not we would actually be able to revive an extinct species  I would have said  pipe dream. But I'm actually standing here today  amazingly  to tell you that not only is the sequencing of extinct genomes a possibility  actually a modern day reality  but the revival of an extinct species is actually within reach  maybe not from the insects in amber    in fact  this mosquito was actually used for the inspiration for  Jurassic Park    but from woolly mammoths  the well preserved remains of woolly mammoths in the permafrost. Woollies are a particularly interesting  quintessential image of the Ice Age. They were large. They were hairy. They had large tusks  and we seem to have a very deep connection with them  like we do with elephants. Maybe it's because elephants share many things in common with us. They bury their dead. They educate the next of kin. They have social knits that are very close. Or maybe it's actually because we're bound by deep time  because elephants  like us  share their origins in Africa some seven million years ago  and as habitats changed and environments changed  we actually  like the elephants  migrated out into Europe and Asia. So the first large mammoth that appears on the scene is meridionalis  which was standing four meters tall weighing about    tons  and was a woodland adapted species and spread from Western Europe clear across Central Asia  across the Bering land bridge and into parts of North America. And then  again  as climate changed as it always does  and new habitats opened up  we had the arrival of a steppe adapted species called trogontherii in Central Asia pushing meridionalis out into Western Europe. And the open grassland savannas of North America opened up  leading to the Columbian mammoth  a large  hairless species in North America. And it was really only about         years later that we had the arrival of the woolly  the one that we all know and love so much  spreading from an East Beringian point of origin across Central Asia  again pushing the trogontherii out through Central Europe  and over hundreds of thousands of years migrating back and forth across the Bering land bridge during times of glacial peaks and coming into direct contact with the Columbian relatives living in the south  and there they survive over hundreds of thousands of years during traumatic climatic shifts. So there's a highly plastic animal dealing with great transitions in temperature and environment  and doing very  very well. And there they survive on the mainland until about        years ago  and actually  surprisingly  on the small islands off of Siberia and Alaska until about       years ago. So Egyptians are building pyramids and woollies are still living on islands. And then they disappear. Like    percent of all the animals that have once lived  they go extinct  likely due to a warming climate and fast encroaching dense forests that are migrating north  and also  as the late  great Paul Martin once put it  probably Pleistocene overkill  so the large game hunters that took them down. Fortunately  we find millions of their remains strewn across the permafrost buried deep in Siberia and Alaska  and we can actually go up there and actually take them out. And the preservation is  again  like those insects in  amber   phenomenal. So you have teeth  bones with blood which look like blood  you have hair  and you have intact carcasses or heads which still have brains in them. So the preservation and the survival of DNA depends on many factors  and I have to admit  most of which we still don't quite understand  but depending upon when an organism dies and how quickly he's buried  the depth of that burial  the constancy of the temperature of that burial environment  will ultimately dictate how long DNA will survive over geologically meaningful time frames. And it's probably surprising to many of you sitting in this room that it's not the time that matters  it's not the length of preservation  it's the consistency of the temperature of that preservation that matters most. So if we were to go deep now within the bones and the teeth that actually survived the fossilization process  the DNA which was once intact  tightly wrapped around histone proteins  is now under attack by the bacteria that lived symbiotically with the mammoth for years during its lifetime. So those bacteria  along with the environmental bacteria  free water and oxygen  actually break apart the DNA into smaller and smaller and smaller DNA fragments  until all you have are fragments that range from    base pairs to  in the best case scenarios  a few hundred base pairs in length. So most fossils out there in the fossil record are actually completely devoid of all organic signatures. But a few of them actually have DNA fragments that survive for thousands  even a few millions of years in time. And using state of the art clean room technology  we've devised ways that we can actually pull these DNAs away from all the rest of the gunk in there  and it's not surprising to any of you sitting in the room that if I take a mammoth bone or a tooth and I extract its DNA that I'll get mammoth DNA  but I'll also get all the bacteria that once lived with the mammoth  and  more complicated  I'll get all the DNA that survived in that environment with it  so the bacteria  the fungi  and so on and so forth. Not surprising then again that a mammoth preserved in the permafrost will have something on the order of    percent of its DNA being mammoth  whereas something like the Columbian mammoth  living in a temperature and buried in a temperate environment over its laying in will only have   to    percent endogenous. But we've come up with very clever ways that we can actually discriminate  capture and discriminate  the mammoth from the non mammoth DNA  and with the advances in high throughput sequencing  we can actually pull out and bioinformatically re jig all these small mammoth fragments and place them onto a backbone of an Asian or African elephant chromosome. And so by doing that  we can actually get all the little points that discriminate between a mammoth and an Asian elephant  and what do we know  then  about a mammoth  Well  the mammoth genome is almost at full completion  and we know that it's actually really big. It's mammoth. So a hominid genome is about three billion base pairs  but an elephant and mammoth genome is about two billion base pairs larger  and most of that is composed of small  repetitive DNAs that make it very difficult to actually re jig the entire structure of the genome. So having this information allows us to answer one of the interesting relationship questions between mammoths and their living relatives  the African and the Asian elephant  all of which shared an ancestor seven million years ago  but the genome of the mammoth shows it to share a most recent common ancestor with Asian elephants about six million years ago  so slightly closer to the Asian elephant. With advances in ancient DNA technology  we can actually now start to begin to sequence the genomes of those other extinct mammoth forms that I mentioned  and I just wanted to talk about two of them  the woolly and the Columbian mammoth  both of which were living very close to each other during glacial peaks  so when the glaciers were massive in North America  the woollies were pushed into these subglacial ecotones  and came into contact with the relatives living to the south  and there they shared refugia  and a little bit more than the refugia  it turns out. It looks like they were interbreeding. And that this is not an uncommon feature in Proboscideans  because it turns out that large savanna male elephants will outcompete the smaller forest elephants for their females. So large  hairless Columbians outcompeting the smaller male woollies. It reminds me a bit of high school  unfortunately. So this is not trivial  given the idea that we want to revive extinct species  because it turns out that an African and an Asian elephant can actually interbreed and have live young  and this has actually occurred by accident in a zoo in Chester  U.K.  in     . So that means that we can actually take Asian elephant chromosomes  modify them into all those positions we've actually now been able to discriminate with the mammoth genome  we can put that into an enucleated cell  differentiate that into a stem cell  subsequently differentiate that maybe into a sperm  artificially inseminate an Asian elephant egg  and over a long and arduous procedure  actually bring back something that looks like this. Now  this wouldn't be an exact replica  because the short DNA fragments that I told you about will prevent us from building the exact structure  but it would make something that looked and felt very much like a woolly mammoth did. Now  when I bring up this with my friends  we often talk about  well  where would you put it  Where are you going to house a mammoth  There's no climates or habitats suitable. Well  that's not actually the case. It turns out that there are swaths of habitat in the north of Siberia and Yukon that actually could house a mammoth. Remember  this was a highly plastic animal that lived over tremendous climate variation. So this landscape would be easily able to house it  and I have to admit that there  is  a part of the child in me  the boy in me  that would love to see these majestic creatures walk across the permafrost of the north once again  but I do have to admit that part of the adult in me sometimes wonders whether or not we should. Thank you very much. Ryan Phelan  Don't go away. You've left us with a question. I'm sure everyone is asking this. When you say   Should we   it feels like you're reticent there  and yet you've given us a vision of it being so possible. What's your reticence  Hendrik Poinar  I don't think it's reticence. I think it's just that we have to think very deeply about the implications  ramifications of our actions  and so as long as we have good  deep discussion like we're having now  I think we can come to a very good solution as to why to do it. But I just want to make sure that we spend time thinking about why we're doing it first. RP  Perfect. Perfect answer. Thank you very much  Hendrik. HP  Thank you.  Applause  So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan  China in the     s. When I was in the first grade  the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes  all expenses paid. But my tiger mother said   No.  My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them. After surviving the Cultural Revolution  they firmly believed there's only one sure way to happiness  a safe and well paid job. It is not important if I like the job or not. But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer. That is me playing my imaginary piano. An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics  so I tried everything I could to go to opera school. I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show. But no adults liked the idea. No adults believed I was serious. Only my friends supported me  but they were kids  just as powerless as I was. So at age     I knew I was too old to be trained. My dream would never come true. I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second class happiness would be the best I could hope for. But that's so unfair. So I was determined to find another calling. Nobody around to teach me  Fine. I turned to books. I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians.  Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei   I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience.  Jane Eyre   And I learned to be efficient from this book.  Cheaper by the Dozen   And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these.   Complete Works of Sanmao   aka Echo Chan     Lessons From History  by Nan Huaijin  I came to the U.S. in       so which books did I read here first  Books banned in China  of course.  The Good Earth  is about Chinese peasant life. That's just not convenient for propaganda. Got it. The Bible is interesting  but strange. That's a topic for a different day. But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany   You shall honor your father and mother.   Honor   I said.  That's so different  and better  than obey.  So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents. Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading. It offers many insights. For example  I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with. It had never occurred to me  China doesn't have to be at the center of the world. A map actually carries somebody's view. Comparative reading actually is nothing new. It's a standard practice in the academic world. There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature. Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic. So I thought  well  if comparative reading works for research  why not do it in daily life too  So I started reading books in pairs. So they can be about people      Benjamin Franklin  by Walter Isaacson   John Adams  by David McCullough     who are involved in the same event  or friends with shared experiences.   Personal History  by Katharine Graham   The Snowball  Warren Buffett and the Business of Life   by Alice Schroeder  I also compare the same stories in different genres     Laughter   Holy Bible  King James Version   Lamb  by Chrisopher Moore     or similar stories from different cultures  as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book.  The Power of Myth  by Joseph Campbell  For example  both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations. For the Christ  the temptations are economic  political and spiritual. For the Buddha  they are all psychological  lust  fear and social duty    interesting. So if you know a foreign language  it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.   The Way of Chuang Tzu  Thomas Merton   Tao  The Watercourse Way  Alan Watts  Instead of lost in translation  I found there is much to gain. For example  it's through translation that I realized  happiness  in Chinese literally means  fast joy.  Huh   Bride  in Chinese literally means  new mother.  Uh oh. Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present. I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again. Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered. I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream. Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from  where passion comes from  where happiness comes from. Even a shattered dream can do that for you. So because of books  I'm here today  happy  living again with a purpose and a clarity  most of the time. So may books be always with you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you.  Applause
