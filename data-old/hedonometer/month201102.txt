I'm going to have a pretty simple idea that I'm just going to tell you over and over until I get you to believe it  and that is all of us are makers. I really believe that. All of us are makers. We're born makers. We have this ability to make things  to grasp things with our hands. We use words like  grasp  metaphorically to also think about understanding things. We don't just live  but we make. We create things. Well I'm going to show you a group of makers from Maker Faire and various places. It doesn't come out particularly well  but that's a particularly tall bicycle. It's a scraper bike  it's called    from Oakland. And this is a particularly small scooter for a gentleman of this size. But he's trying to power it  or motorize it  with a drill. And the question he had is   Can I do it  Can it be done   Apparently it can. So makers are enthusiasts  they're amateurs  they're people who love doing what they do. They don't always even know why they're doing it. We have begun organizing makers at our Maker Faire. There was one held in Detroit here last summer  and it will be held again next summer  at the Henry Ford. But we hold them in San Francisco       and in New York. And it's a fabulous event to just meet and talk to these people who make things and are there to just show them to you and talk about them and have a great conversation. Dale Dougherty  These are electric muffins. Guy  Where did you guys get those  Muffin  Will you glide with us   Guy  No.  DD  I know Ford has new electric vehicles coming out. We got there first. Lady  Will you glide with us  DD  This is something I call  swinging in the rain.  And you can barely see it  but it's    a controller at top cycles the water to fall just before and after you pass through the bottom of the arc. So imagine a kid   Am I going to get wet  Am I going to get wet  No  I didn't get wet. Am I going to get wet  Am I going to get wet   That's the experience of a clever ride. And of course  we have fashion. People are remaking things into fashion. I don't know if this is called a basket bra  but it ought to be something like that. We have art students getting together  taking old radiator parts and doing an iron pour to make something new out of it. They did that in the summer  and it was very warm. Now this one takes a little bit of explaining. You know what those are  right  Billy Bob  or Billy Bass  or something like that. Now the background is    the guy who did this is a physicist. And here he'll explain a little bit about what it does. and this is the Sashimi Tabernacle Choir. Choir    When you hold me in your arms   DD  This is all computer controlled in an old Volvo. Choir    I'm hooked on a feelin'     I'm high on believin'     That you're in love with me   DD  So Richard came up from Houston last year to visit us in Detroit here and show the wonderful Sashimi Tabernacle Choir. So  are you a maker  How many people here would say you're a maker  if you raise your hand  That's a pretty good    but there's some of you out there that won't admit that you're makers. And again  think about it. You're makers of food  you're makers of shelter  you're makers of lots of different things  and partly what interests me today is you're makers of your own world  and particularly the role that technology has in your life. You're really a driver or a passenger    to use a Volkswagen phrase. Makers are in control. That's what fascinates them. That's why they do what they do. They want to figure out how things work  they want to get access to it  and they want to control it. They want to use it to their own purpose. Makers today  to some degree  are out on the edge. They're not mainstream. They're a little bit radical. They're a bit subversive in what they do. But at one time  it was fairly commonplace to think of yourself as a maker. It was not something you'd even remark upon. And I found this old video. And I'll tell you more about it  but just ... we are makers. With our strengths and our minds and spirit  we gather  we form  and we fashion. Makers and shapers and put it togetherers. DD  So it goes on to show you people making things out of wood  a grandfather making a ship in a bottle  a woman making a pie    somewhat standard fare of the day. But it was a sense of pride that we made things  that the world around us was made by us. It didn't just exist. We made it  and we were connected to it that way. And I think that's tremendously important. Now I'm going to tell you one funny thing about this. This particular reel    it's an industrial video    but it was shown in drive in theaters in         in the Detroit area  in fact    and it preceded Alfred Hitchcock's  Psycho.  So I like to think there was something going on there of the new generation of makers coming out of this  plus  Psycho.  This is Andrew Archer. I met Andrew at one of our community meetings putting together Maker Faire. Andrew had moved to Detroit from Duluth  Minnesota. And I talked to his mom  and I ended up doing a story on him for a magazine called Kidrobot. He's just a kid that grew up playing with tools instead of toys. He liked to take things apart. His mother gave him a part of the garage  and he collected things from yard sales  and he made stuff. And then he didn't particularly like school that much  but he got involved in robotics competitions  and he realized he had a talent  and  more importantly  he had a real passion for it. And he began building robots. And when I sat down next to him  he was telling me about a company he formed  and he was building some robots for automobile factories to move things around on the factory floor. And that's why he moved to Michigan. But he also moved here to meet other people doing what he's doing. And this kind of gets to this important idea today. This is Jeff and Bilal and several others here in a hackerspace. And there's about three hackerspaces or more in Detroit. And there's probably even some new ones since I've been here last. But these are like clubs    they're sharing tools  sharing space  sharing expertise in what to make. And so it's a very interesting phenomenon that's going across the world. But essentially these are people that are playing with technology. Let me say that again  playing. They don't necessarily know what they're doing or why they're doing it. They're playing to discover what the technology can do  and probably to discover what they can do themselves  what their own capabilities are. Now the other thing that I think is taking off  another reason making is taking off today  is there's some great new tools out there. And you can't see this very well on the screen  but Arduino    Arduino is an open source hardware platform. It's a micro controller. If you don't know what those are  they're just the  brains.  So they're the brains of maker projects  and here's an example of one. And I don't know if you can see it that well  but that's a mailbox    so an ordinary mailbox and an Arduino. So you figure out how to program this  and you put this in your mailbox. And when someone opens your mailbox  you get a notification  an alert message goes to your iPhone. Now that could be a dog door  it could be someone going somewhere where they shouldn't  like a little brother into a little sister's room. There's all kinds of different things that you can imagine for that. Now here's something    a  D printer. That's another tool that's really taken off    really  really interesting. This is Makerbot. And there are industrial versions of this    about        dollars. These guys came up with a kit version for     dollars  and that means that hobbyists and ordinary folks can get a hold of this and begin playing with  D printers. Now they don't know what they want to do with it  but they're going to figure it out. They will only figure it out by getting their hands on it and playing with it. One of the coolest things is  Makerbot sent out an upgrade  some new brackets for the box. Well you printed out the brackets and then replaced the old brackets with the new ones. Isn't that cool  So makers harvest technology from all the places around us. This is a radar speed detector that was developed from a Hot Wheels toy. And they do interesting things. They're really creating new areas and exploring areas that you might only think    the military is doing drones    well  there is a whole community of people building autonomous airplanes  or vehicles    something that you could program to fly on its own  without a stick or anything  to figure out what path it's going. Fascinating work they're doing. We just had an issue on space exploration  DIY space exploration. This is probably the best time in the history of mankind to love space. You could build your own satellite and get it into space for like       dollars. Think how much money and how many years it took NASA to get satellites into space. In fact  these guys actually work for NASA  and they're trying to pioneer using off the shelf components  cheap things that aren't specialized that they can combine and send up into space. Makers are a source of innovation  and I think it relates back to something like the birth of the personal computer industry. This is Steve Wozniak. Where does he learn about computers  It's the Homebrew Computer Club    just like a hackerspace. And he says   I could go there all day long and talk to people and share ideas for free.  Well he did a little bit better than free. But it's important to understand that a lot of the origins of our industries    even like Henry Ford    come from this idea of playing and figuring things out in groups. Well  if I haven't convinced you that you're a maker  I hope I could convince you that our next generation should be makers  that kids are particularly interested in this  in this ability to control the physical world and be able to use things like micro controllers and build robots. And we've got to get this into schools  or into communities in many  many ways    the ability to tinker  to shape and reshape the world around us. There's a great opportunity today    and that's what I really care about the most. An the answer to the question  what will America make  It's more makers. Thank you very much. I'm going to make an argument today that may seem a little bit crazy  social media and the end of gender. Let me connect the dots. I'm going to argue today that the social media applications that we all know and love  or love to hate  are actually going to help free us from some of the absurd assumptions that we have as a society about gender. I think that social media is actually going to help us dismantle some of the silly and demeaning stereotypes that we see in media and advertising about gender. If you hadn't noticed  our media climate generally provides a very distorted mirror of our lives and of our gender  and I think that's going to change. Now most media companies    television  radio  publishing  games  you name it    they use very rigid segmentation methods in order to understand their audiences. It's old school demographics. They come up with these very restrictive labels to define us. Now the crazy thing is that media companies believe that if you fall within a certain demographic category then you are predictable in certain ways    you have certain taste  that you like certain things. And so the bizarre result of this is that most of our popular culture is actually based on these presumptions about our demographics. Age demographics  the    to    demo has had a huge impact on all mass media programming in this country since the     s  when the baby boomers were still young. Now they've aged out of that demographic  but it's still the case that powerful ratings companies like Nielson don't even take into account viewers of television shows over age   . In our media environment  it's as if they don't even exist. Now  if you watch  Mad Men   like I do    it's a popular TV show in the States    Dr. Faye Miller does something called psychographics  which first came about in the     s  where you create these complex psychological profiles of consumers. But psychographics really haven't had a huge impact on the media business. It's really just been basic demographics. So I'm at the Norman Lear Center at USC  and we've done a lot of research over the last seven  eight years on demographics and how they affect media and entertainment in this country and abroad. And in the last three years  we've been looking specifically at social media to see what has changed  and we've discovered some very interesting things. All the people who participate in social media networks belong to the same old demographic categories that media companies and advertisers have used in order to understand them. But those categories mean even less now than they did before  because with online networking tools  it's much easier for us to escape some of our demographic boxes. We're able to connect with people quite freely and to redefine ourselves online. And we can lie about our age online  too  pretty easily. We can also connect with people based on our very specific interests. We don't need a media company to help do this for us. So the traditional media companies  of course  are paying very close attention to these online communities. They know this is the mass audience of the future  they need to figure it out. But they're having a hard time doing it because they're still trying to use demographics in order to understand them  because that's how ad rates are still determined. When they're monitoring your clickstream    and you know they are    they have a really hard time figuring out your age  your gender and your income. They can make some educated guesses. But they get a lot more information about what you do online  what you like  what interests you. That's easier for them to find out than who you are. And even though that's still sort of creepy  there is an upside to having your taste monitored. Suddenly our taste is being respected in a way that it hasn't been before. It had been presumed before. So when you look online at the way people aggregate  they don't aggregate around age  gender and income. They aggregate around the things they love  the things that they like  and if you think about it  shared interests and values are a far more powerful aggregator of human beings than demographic categories. I'd much rather know whether you like  Buffy the Vampire Slayer  rather than how old you are. That would tell me something more substantial about you. Now there's something else that we've discovered about social media that's actually quite surprising. It turns out that women are really driving the social media revolution. If you look at the statistics    these are worldwide statistics    in every single age category  women actually outnumber men in their use of social networking technologies. And then if you look at the amount of time that they spend on these sites  they truly dominate the social media space  which is a space that's having a huge impact on old media. The question is  what sort of impact is this going to have on our culture  and what's it going to mean for women  If the case is that social media is dominating old media and women are dominating social media  then does that mean that women are going to take over global media  Are we suddenly going to see a lot more female characters in cartoons and in games and on TV shows  Will the next big budget blockbuster movies actually be chick flicks  Could this be possible  that suddenly our media landscape will become a feminist landscape  Well  I actually don't think that's going to be the case. I think that media companies are going to hire a lot more women  because they realize this is important for their business  and I think that women are also going to continue to dominate the social media sphere. But I think women are actually going to be    ironically enough    responsible for driving a stake through the heart of cheesy genre categories like the  chick flick  and all these other genre categories that presume that certain demographic groups like certain things    that Hispanics like certain things  that young people like certain things. This is far too simplistic. The future entertainment media that we're going to see is going to be very data driven  and it's going to be based on the information that we ascertain from taste communities online  where women are really driving the action. So you may be asking  well why is it important that I know what entertains people  Why should I know this  Of course  old media companies and advertisers need to know this. But my argument is that  if you want to understand the global village  it's probably a good idea that you figure out what they're passionate about  what amuses them  what they choose to do in their free time. This is a very important thing to know about people. I've spent most of my professional life researching media and entertainment and its impact on people's lives. And I do it not just because it's fun    though actually  it is really fun    but also because our research has shown over and over again that entertainment and play have a huge impact on people's lives    for instance  on their political beliefs and on their health. And so  if you have any interest in understanding the world  looking at how people amuse themselves is a really good way to start. So imagine a media atmosphere that isn't dominated by lame stereotypes about gender and other demographic characteristics. Can you even imagine what that looks like  I can't wait to find out what it looks like. Thank you so much. Running    it's basically just right  left  right  left    yeah  I mean  we've been doing it for two million years  so it's kind of arrogant to assume that I've got something to say that hasn't been said and performed better a long time ago. But the cool thing about running  as I've discovered  is that something bizarre happens in this activity all the time. Case in point  A couple months ago  if you saw the New York City Marathon  I guarantee you  you saw something that no one has ever seen before. An Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu turns up at the starting line. She's    years old  she hasn't won a marathon of any kind in eight years  and a few months previously she almost died in childbirth. Derartu Tulu was ready to hang it up and retire from the sport  but she decided she'd go for broke and try for one last big payday in the marquee event  the New York City Marathon. Except    bad news for Derartu Tulu    some other people had the same idea  including the Olympic gold medalist and Paula Radcliffe  who is a monster  the fastest woman marathoner in history by far. Only    minutes off the men's world record  Paula Radcliffe is essentially unbeatable. That's her competition. The gun goes off  and she's not even an underdog. She's under the underdogs. But the under underdog hangs tough  and    miles into a    mile race  there is Derartu Tulu up there with the lead pack. Now this is when something really bizarre happens. Paula Radcliffe  the one person who is sure to snatch the big paycheck out of Derartu Tulu's under underdog hands  suddenly grabs her leg and starts to fall back. So we all know what to do in this situation  right  You give her a quick crack in the teeth with your elbow and blaze for the finish line. Derartu Tulu ruins the script. Instead of taking off  she falls back  and she grabs Paula Radcliffe  says   Come on. Come with us. You can do it.  So Paula Radcliffe  unfortunately  does it. She catches up with the lead pack and is pushing toward the finish line. But then she falls back again. And the second time Derartu Tulu grabs her and tries to pull her. And Paula Radcliffe at that point says   I'm done. Go.  So that's a fantastic story  and we all know how it ends. She loses the check  but she goes home with something bigger and more important. Except Derartu Tulu ruins the script again    instead of losing  she blazes past the lead pack and wins  wins the New York City Marathon  goes home with a big fat check. It's a heartwarming story  but if you drill a little bit deeper  you've got to sort of wonder about what exactly was going on there. When you have two outliers in one organism  it's not a coincidence. When you have someone who is more competitive and more compassionate than anybody else in the race  again  it's not a coincidence. You show me a creature with webbed feet and gills  somehow water's involved. Someone with that kind of heart  there's some kind of connection there. And the answer to it  I think  can be found down in the Copper Canyons of Mexico  where there's a tribe  a reclusive tribe  called the Tarahumara Indians. Now the Tarahumara are remarkable for three things. Number one is  they have been living essentially unchanged for the past     years. When the conquistadors arrived in North America you had two choices  you either fight back and engage or you could take off. The Mayans and Aztecs engaged  which is why there are very few Mayans and Aztecs. The Tarahumara had a different strategy. They took off and hid in this labyrinthine  networking  spiderwebbing system of canyons called the Copper Canyons  and there they remained since the     s    essentially the same way they've always been. The second thing remarkable about the Tarahumara is  deep into old age       to    years old    these guys aren't running marathons  they're running mega marathons. They're not doing    miles  they're doing          miles at a time  and apparently without injury  without problems. The last thing that's remarkable about the Tarahumara is that all the things that we're going to be talking about today  all the things that we're trying to come up with using all of our technology and brain power to solve    things like heart disease and cholesterol and cancer and crime and warfare and violence and clinical depression    all this stuff  the Tarahumara don't know what you're talking about. They are free from all of these modern ailments. So what's the connection  Again  we're talking about outliers    there's got to be some kind of cause and effect there. Well  there are teams of scientists at Harvard and the University of Utah that are bending their brains to try to figure out what the Tarahumara have known forever. They're trying to solve those same kinds of mysteries. And once again  a mystery wrapped inside of a mystery    perhaps the key to Derartu Tulu and the Tarahumara is wrapped in three other mysteries  which go like this  three things    if you have the answer  come up and take the microphone  because nobody else knows the answer. And if you know it  then you are smarter than anybody else on planet Earth. Mystery number one is this  Two million years ago the human brain exploded in size. Australopithecus had a tiny little pea brain. Suddenly humans show up    Homo erectus    big  old melon head. To have a brain of that size  you need to have a source of condensed caloric energy. In other words  early humans are eating dead animals    no argument  that's a fact. The only problem is  the first edged weapons only appeared about         years ago. So  somehow  for nearly two million years  we are killing animals without any weapons. Now we're not using our strength because we are the biggest sissies in the jungle. Every other animal is stronger than we are    they have fangs  they have claws  they have nimbleness  they have speed. We think Usain Bolt is fast. Usain Bolt can get his ass kicked by a squirrel. We're not fast. That would be an Olympic event  turn a squirrel loose    whoever catches the squirrel  you get a gold medal. So no weapons  no speed  no strength  no fangs  no claws    how were we killing these animals  Mystery number one. Mystery number two  Women have been in the Olympics for quite some time now  but one thing that's remarkable about all women sprinters    they all suck  they're terrible. There's not a fast woman on the planet and there never has been. The fastest woman to ever run a mile did it in     . I could throw a rock and hit a high school boy who can run faster than     . For some reason you guys are just really slow. But you get to the marathon we were just talking about    you guys have only been allowed to run the marathon for    years. Because  prior to the     s  medical science said that if a woman tried to run    miles    does anyone know what would happen if you tried to run    miles  why you were banned from the marathon before the     s  Yes. You would have torn reproductive organs. The uterus would fall out  literally fall out of the body. Now I've been to a lot of marathons  and I've yet to see any ... So it's only been    years that women have been allowed to run the marathon. In that very short learning curve  you guys have gone from broken organs up to the fact that you're only    minutes off the male world record. Then you go beyond    miles  into the distance that medical science also told us would be fatal to humans    remember Pheidippides died when he ran    miles    you get to    and     miles  and suddenly it's a different game. You can take a runner like Ann Trason  or Nikki Kimball  or Jenn Shelton  you put them in a race of    or     miles against anybody in the world and it's a coin toss who's going to win. I'll give you an example. A couple years ago  Emily Baer signed up for a race called the Hardrock      which tells you all you need to know about the race. They give you    hours to finish this race. Well Emily Baer        runners    she finishes in eighth place  in the top     even though she stopped at all the aid stations to breastfeed her baby during the race    and yet  beat     other people. So why is it that women get stronger as distances get longer  The third mystery is this  At the University of Utah  they started tracking finishing times for people running the marathon. And what they found is that  if you start running the marathon at age     you will get progressively faster  year by year  until you reach your peak at age   . And then after that  you succumb to the rigors of time. And you'll get slower and slower  until eventually you're back to running the same speed you were at age   . So about seven years  eight years to reach your peak  and then gradually you fall off your peak  until you go back to the starting point. You would think it might take eight years to go back to the same speed  maybe    years    no  it's    years.    year old men and women are running as fast as they were at age   . Now I defy you to come up with any other physical activity    and please don't say golf    something that actually is hard    where geriatrics are performing as well as they did as teenagers. So you have these three mysteries. Is there one piece in the puzzle which might wrap all these things up  You've got to be really careful any time someone looks back in prehistory and tries to give you some sort of global answer  because  it being prehistory  you can say whatever the hell you want and get away with it. But I'll submit this to you  If you put one piece in the middle of this jigsaw puzzle  suddenly it all starts to form a coherent picture. If you wonder  why it is the Tarahumara don't fight and don't die of heart disease  why a poor Ethiopian woman named Derartu Tulu can be the most compassionate and yet the most competitive  and why we somehow were able to find food without weapons  perhaps it's because humans  as much as we like to think of ourselves as masters of the universe  actually evolved as nothing more than a pack of hunting dogs. Maybe we evolved as a hunting pack animal. Because the one advantage we have in the wilderness    again  it's not our fangs and our claws and our speed    the only thing we do really  really well is sweat. We're really good at being sweaty and smelly. Better than any other mammal on Earth  we can sweat really well. But the advantage of that little bit of social discomfort is the fact that  when it comes to running under hot heat for long distances  we're superb  we're the best on the planet. You take a horse on a hot day  and after about five or six miles  that horse has a choice. It's either going to breathe or it's going to cool off  but it ain't doing both    we can. So what if we evolved as hunting pack animals  What if the only natural advantage we had in the world was the fact that we could get together as a group  go out there on that African Savannah  pick out an antelope and go out as a pack and run that thing to death  That's all we could do. We could run really far on a hot day. Well if that's true  a couple other things had to be true as well. The key to being part of a hunting pack is the word  pack.  If you go out by yourself  and you try to chase an antelope  I guarantee you there's going to be two cadavers out there in the Savannah. You need a pack to pull together. You need to have those         year olds who have been doing this for a long time to understand which antelope you're actually trying to catch. The herd explodes and it gathers back again. Those expert trackers have got to be part of the pack. They can't be    miles behind. You need to have the women and the adolescents there because the two times in your life you most benefit from animal protein is when you are a nursing mother and a developing adolescent. It makes no sense to have the antelope over there dead and the people who want to eat it    miles away. They need to be part of the pack. You need to have those    year old studs at the peak of their powers ready to drop the kill  and you need to have those teenagers there who are learning the whole thing all involved. The pack stays together. Another thing that has to be true about this pack  this pack cannot be really materialistic. You can't be hauling all your crap around  trying to chase the antelope. You can't be a pissed off pack. You can't be bearing grudges  like   I'm not chasing that guy's antelope. He pissed me off. Let him go chase his own antelope.  The pack has got to be able to swallow its ego  be cooperative and pull together. What you end up with  in other words  is a culture remarkably similar to the Tarahumara    a tribe that has remained unchanged since the Stone Age. It's a really compelling argument that maybe the Tarahumara are doing exactly what all of us had done for two million years  that it's us in modern times who have sort of gone off the path. You know  we look at running as this kind of alien  foreign thing  this punishment you've got to do because you ate pizza the night before. But maybe it's something different. Maybe we're the ones who have taken this natural advantage we had and we spoiled it. How do we spoil it  Well how do we spoil anything  We try to cash in on it. We try to can it and package it and make it  better  and sell it to people. And what happened was we started creating these fancy cushioned things  which can make running  better   called running shoes. The reason I get personally pissed off about running shoes is because I bought a million of them and I kept getting hurt. And I think that  if anybody in here runs    and I just had a conversation with Carol  we talked for two minutes backstage  and she's talking about plantar fasciitis. You talk to a runner  I guarantee  within    seconds  the conversation turns to injury. So if humans evolved as runners  if that's our one natural advantage  why are we so bad at it  Why do we keep getting hurt  Curious thing about running and running injuries is that the running injury is new to our time. If you read folklore and mythology  any kind of myths  any kind of tall tales  running is always associated with freedom and vitality and youthfulness and eternal vigor. It's only in our lifetime that running has become associated with fear and pain. Geronimo used to say that   My only friends are my legs. I only trust my legs.  That's because an Apache triathlon used to be you'd run    miles across the desert  engage in hand to hand combat  steal a bunch of horses and slap leather for home. Geronimo was never saying   Ah  you know something  my achilles    I'm tapering. I got to take this week off   or  I need to cross train. I didn't do yoga. I'm not ready.  Humans ran and ran all the time. We are here today. We have our digital technology. All of our science comes from the fact that our ancestors were able to do something extraordinary every day  which was just rely on their naked feet and legs to run long distances. So how do we get back to that again  Well  I would submit to you the first thing is get rid of all packaging  all the sales  all the marketing. Get rid of all the stinking running shoes. Stop focusing on urban marathons  which  if you do four hours  you suck. If you do          you're awesome  because you qualified for another race. We need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and  I would say  nakedness  that has made the Tarahumara one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time. So what's the benefit  So what  So you burn off the Haagen Dazs from the night before  But maybe there's another benefit there as well. Without getting a little too extreme about this  imagine a world where everybody could go out their door and engage in the kind of exercise that's going to make them more relaxed  more serene  more healthy  burn off stress    where you don't come back into your office a raging maniac anymore  where you don't go back home with a lot of stress on top of you again. Maybe there's something between what we are today and what the Tarahumara have always been. I don't say let's go back to the Copper Canyons and live on corn and maize  which is the Tarahumara's preferred diet  but maybe there's somewhere in between. And if we find that thing  maybe there is a big fat Nobel Prize out there. Because if somebody could find a way to restore that natural ability that we all enjoyed for most of our existence  up until the     s or so  the benefits  social and physical and political and mental  could be astounding. So what I've been seeing today is there is a growing subculture of barefoot runners  people who got rid of their shoes. And what they have found uniformly is you get rid of the shoes  you get rid of the stress  you get rid of the injuries and the ailments. And what you find is something the Tarahumara have known for a very long time  that this can be a whole lot of fun. I've experienced it personally myself. I was injured all my life  and then in my early   s I got rid of my shoes and my running ailments have gone away too. So hopefully it's something we can all benefit from. And I appreciate you guys listening to this story. Thanks very much.  What I Will  I will not dance to your war drum. I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum. I will not dance to that beating. I know that beat. It is lifeless. I know intimately that skin you are hitting. It was alive once  hunted  stolen  stretched. I will not dance to your drummed up war. I will not pop  spin  break for you. I will not hate for you or even hate you. I will not kill for you. Especially I will not die for you. I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide. I will not side with you or dance to bombs because everyone is dancing. Everyone can be wrong. Life is a right  not collateral or casual. I will not forget where I come from. I will craft my own drum. Gather my beloved near  and our chanting will be dancing. Our humming will be drumming. I will not be played. I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat. I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance. This heartbeat is louder than death. Your war drum ain't louder than this breath. Haaa. What's up TED people  Let me hear you make some noise. A bunch of pacifists. Confused  aspiring pacifists. I understand. I've been wrong a lot lately. Like a lot. So I couldn't figure out what to read today. I mean  I've been saying I've been prepping. What that means is prepping my outfit  prepping options  trying to figure out what I'm coming behind and going in front of. Poetry does that. It preps you. It aims you. So I am going to read a poem that was chosen just now. But I'm going to need you to just sit for like    minutes and hold a woman who is not here. Hold her now with you. You don't need to say her name out loud  you can just hold her. Are you holding her  This is  Break Clustered.  All holy history banned. Unwritten books predicted the future  projected the past. But my head unwraps around what appears limitless  man's creative violence. Whose son shall it be  Which male child will perish a new day  Our boys' deaths galvanize. We cherish corpses. We mourn women  complicated. Bitches get beat daily. Profits made  prophets ignored. War and tooth  enameled salted lemon childhoods. All colors run  none of us solid. Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within. I live cycles of light and darkness. Rhythm is half silence. I see now  I never was one and not the other. Sickness  health  tender violence. I think now I never was pure. Before form I was storm  blind  ign'ant    still am. Human contracted itself blind  malignant. I never was pure. Girl spoiled before ripened. Language can't math me. I experience exponentially. Everything is everything. One woman loses     maybe     members of her family. One woman loses six. One woman loses her head. One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash. One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband. One woman straps herself. One woman gives birth to a baby. One woman gives birth to borders. One woman no longer believes love will ever find her. One woman never did. Where do refugee hearts go  Broken  dissed  placed where they're not from  don't want to be missed. Faced with absence. We mourn each one or we mean nothing at all. My spine curves spiral. Precipice running to and running from human beings. Cluster bombs left behind. De facto landmines. A smoldering grief. Harvest contaminated tobacco. Harvest bombs. Harvest baby teeth. Harvest palms  smoke. Harvest witness  smoke. Resolutions  smoke. Salvation  smoke. Redemption  smoke. Breathe. Do not fear what has blown up. If you must  fear the unexploded. Thank you. What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request. I'd like all of you to pause for a moment  you wretched weaklings  and take stock of your miserable existence. Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century. It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned   . Up until that moment  I had been that classic corporate warrior    I was eating too much  I was drinking too much  I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family. And I decided that I would try and turn my life around. In particular  I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work life balance. So I stepped back from the workforce  and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children. But all I learned about work life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn't have any work. Not a very useful skill  especially when the money runs out. So I went back to work  and I've spent these seven years since struggling with  studying and writing about work life balance. And I have four observations I'd like to share with you today. The first is  if society's to make any progress on this issue  we need an honest debate. But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work life balance. All the discussions about flexi time or dress down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue  which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day to day basis with a young family. Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you're in. And the reality of the society that we're in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet  screaming desperation  where they work long  hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don't need to impress people they don't like. It's my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and  a  T shirt isn't really getting to the nub of the issue. The second observation I'd like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren't going to solve this issue for us. We should stop looking outside. It's up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead. If you don't design your life  someone else will design it for you  and you may just not like their idea of balance. It's particularly important    this isn't on the World Wide Web  is it  I'm about to get fired    it's particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation. Now I'm not talking here just about the bad companies    the  abattoirs of the human soul   as I call them. I'm talking about all companies. Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you  as  they can get away with. It's in their nature  it's in their DNA  it's what they do    even the good  well intentioned companies. On the one hand  putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened. On the other hand  it's a nightmare    it just means you spend more time at the bloody office. We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life. The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance. Before I went back to work after my year at home  I sat down and I wrote out a detailed  step by step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to. And it went like this  wake up well rested after a good night's sleep. Have sex. Walk the dog. Have breakfast with my wife and children. Have sex again. Drive the kids to school on the way to the office. Do three hours' work. Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime. Do another three hours' work. Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink. Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids. Meditate for half an hour. Have sex. Walk the dog. Have sex again. Go to bed. How often do you think I have that day  We need to be realistic. You can't do it all in one day. We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life  but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the  I'll have a life when I retire  when my kids have left home  when my wife has divorced me  my health is failing  I've got no mates or interests left.  A day is too short   after I retire  is too long. There's got to be a middle way. A fourth observation  We need to approach balance in a balanced way. A friend came to see me last year    and she doesn't mind me telling this story    a friend came to see me last year and said   Nigel  I've read your book. And I realize that my life is completely out of balance. It's totally dominated by work. I work    hours a day  I commute two hours a day. All of my relationships have failed. There's nothing in my life apart from my work. So I've decided to get a grip and sort it out. So I joined a gym.  Now I don't mean to mock  but being a fit    hour a day office rat isn't more balanced  it's more fit. Lovely though physical exercise may be  there are other parts to life    there's the intellectual side  there's the emotional side  there's the spiritual side. And to be balanced  I believe we have to attend to all of those areas    not just do    stomach crunches. Now that can be daunting. Because people say   Bloody hell mate  I haven't got time to get fit. You want me to go to church and call my mother.  And I understand. I truly understand how that can be daunting. But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective. My wife  who is somewhere in the audience today  called me up at the office and said   Nigel  you need to pick our youngest son     Harry     up from school.  Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening. So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates. We walked down to the local park  messed around on the swings  played some silly games. I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe  and we shared a pizza for two  then walked down the hill to our home  and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas. I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl's  James and the Giant Peach.  I then put him to bed  tucked him in  gave him a kiss on his forehead and said   Goodnight  mate   and walked out of his bedroom. As I was walking out of his bedroom  he said   Dad   I went   Yes  mate   He went   Dad  this has been the best day of my life  ever.  I hadn't done anything  hadn't taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation. Now my point is the small things matter. Being more balanced doesn't mean dramatic upheaval in your life. With the smallest investment in the right places  you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life. Moreover  I think  it can transform society. Because if enough people do it  we can change society's definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins  to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like. And that  I think  is an idea worth spreading. Ever since I was a little girl seeing  Star Wars  for the first time  I've been fascinated by this idea of personal robots. And as a little girl  I loved the idea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful  trusted sidekick    something that would delight us  enrich our lives and help us save a galaxy or two. I knew robots like that didn't really exist  but I knew I wanted to build them. So    years pass    I am now a graduate student at MIT studying artificial intelligence  the year is       and NASA has just landed the first robot on Mars. But robots are still not in our home  ironically. And I remember thinking about all the reasons why that was the case. But one really struck me. Robotics had really been about interacting with things  not with people    certainly not in a social way that would be natural for us and would really help people accept robots into our daily lives. For me  that was the white space  that's what robots could not do yet. And so that year  I started to build this robot  Kismet  the world's first social robot. Three years later    a lot of programming  working with other graduate students in the lab    Kismet was ready to start interacting with people. Kismet   Nonsense  Scientist  This is a watch that my girlfriend gave me. Kismet   Nonsense  Scientist  Yeah  look  it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week. Cynthia Breazeal  So Kismet interacted with people like kind of a non verbal child or pre verbal child  which I assume was fitting because it was really the first of its kind. It didn't speak language  but it didn't matter. This little robot was somehow able to tap into something deeply social within us    and with that  the promise of an entirely new way we could interact with robots. So over the past several years I've been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots  now at the media lab with my own team of incredibly talented students. And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo. We developed Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio. And so I want to show you a special moment for me of Leo. This is Matt Berlin interacting with Leo  introducing Leo to a new object. And because it's new  Leo doesn't really know what to make of it. But sort of like us  he can actually learn about it from watching Matt's reaction. Leo  this is Cookie Monster. Can you find Cookie Monster  Leo  Cookie Monster is very bad. He's very bad  Leo. Cookie Monster is very  very bad. He's a scary monster. He wants to get your cookies. CB  All right  so Leo and Cookie might have gotten off to a little bit of a rough start  but they get along great now. So what I've learned through building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology  where it's actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a partner that is a core part of their functionality. And with that shift in thinking  we can now start to imagine new questions  new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about otherwise. But what do I mean when I say  push our social buttons   Well  one of the things that we've learned is that  if we design these robots to communicate with us using the same body language  the same sort of non verbal cues that people use    like Nexi  our humanoid robot  is doing here    what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to people. People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is  how likable  how engaging  how trustworthy. It turns out it's the same for robots. It's turning out now that robots are actually becoming a really interesting new scientific tool to understand human behavior. To answer questions like  how is it that  from a brief encounter  we're able to make an estimate of how trustworthy another person is  Mimicry's believed to play a role  but how  Is it the mimicking of particular gestures that matters  It turns out it's really hard to learn this or understand this from watching people because when we interact we do all of these cues automatically. We can't carefully control them because they're subconscious for us. But with the robot  you can. And so in this video here    this is a video taken from David DeSteno's lab at Northeastern University. He's a psychologist we've been collaborating with. There's actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi's cues to be able to study this question. And the bottom line is    the reason why this works is because it turns out people just behave like people even when interacting with a robot. So given that key insight  we can now start to imagine new kinds of applications for robots. For instance  if robots do respond to our non verbal cues  maybe they would be a cool  new communication technology. So imagine this  What about a robot accessory for your cellphone  You call your friend  she puts her handset in a robot  and  bam  You're a MeBot    you can make eye contact  you can talk with your friends  you can move around  you can gesture    maybe the next best thing to really being there  or is it  To explore this question  my student  Siggy Adalgeirsson  did a study where we brought human participants  people  into our lab to do a collaborative task with a remote collaborator. The task involved things like looking at a set of objects on the table  discussing them in terms of their importance and relevance to performing a certain task    this ended up being a survival task    and then rating them in terms of how valuable and important they thought they were. The remote collaborator was an experimenter from our group who used one of three different technologies to interact with the participants. The first was just the screen. This is just like video conferencing today. The next was to add mobility    so  have the screen on a mobile base. This is like  if you're familiar with any of the telepresence robots today    this is mirroring that situation. And then the fully expressive MeBot. So after the interaction  we asked people to rate their quality of interaction with the technology  with a remote collaborator through this technology  in a number of different ways. We looked at psychological involvement    how much empathy did you feel for the other person  We looked at overall engagement. We looked at their desire to cooperate. And this is what we see when they use just the screen. It turns out  when you add mobility    the ability to roll around the table    you get a little more of a boost. And you get even more of a boost when you add the full expression. So it seems like this physical  social embodiment actually really makes a difference. Now let's try to put this into a little bit of context. Today we know that families are living further and further apart  and that definitely takes a toll on family relationships and family bonds over distance. For me  I have three young boys  and I want them to have a really good relationship with their grandparents. But my parents live thousands of miles away  so they just don't get to see each other that often. We try Skype  we try phone calls  but my boys are little    they don't really want to talk  they want to play. So I love the idea of thinking about robots as a new kind of distance play technology. I imagine a time not too far from now    my mom can go to her computer  open up a browser and jack into a little robot. And as grandma bot  she can now play  really play  with my sons  with her grandsons  in the real world with his real toys. I could imagine grandmothers being able to do social plays with their granddaughters  with their friends  and to be able to share all kinds of other activities around the house  like sharing a bedtime story. And through this technology  being able to be an active participant in their grandchildren's lives in a way that's not possible today. Let's think about some other domains  like maybe health. So in the United States today  over    percent of people are either overweight or obese  and now it's a big problem with our children as well. And we know that as you get older in life  if you're obese when you're younger  that can lead to chronic diseases that not only reduce your quality of life  but are a tremendous economic burden on our health care system. But if robots can be engaging  if we like to cooperate with robots  if robots are persuasive  maybe a robot can help you maintain a diet and exercise program  maybe they can help you manage your weight. Sort of like a digital Jiminy    as in the well known fairy tale    a kind of friendly  supportive presence that's always there to be able to help you make the right decision in the right way at the right time to help you form healthy habits. So we actually explored this idea in our lab. This is a robot  Autom. Cory Kidd developed this robot for his doctoral work. And it was designed to be a robot diet and exercise coach. It had a couple of simple non verbal skills it could do. It could make eye contact with you. It could share information looking down at a screen. You'd use a screen interface to enter information  like how many calories you ate that day  how much exercise you got. And then it could help track that for you. And the robot spoke with a synthetic voice to engage you in a coaching dialogue modeled after trainers and patients and so forth. And it would build a working alliance with you through that dialogue. It could help you set goals and track your progress  and it would help motivate you. So an interesting question is  does the social embodiment really matter  Does it matter that it's a robot  Is it really just the quality of advice and information that matters  To explore that question  we did a study in the Boston area where we put one of three interventions in people's homes for a period of several weeks. One case was the robot you saw there  Autom. Another was a computer that ran the same touch screen interface  ran exactly the same dialogues. The quality of advice was identical. And the third was just a pen and paper log  because that's the standard intervention you typically get when you start a diet and exercise program. So one of the things we really wanted to look at was not how much weight people lost  but really how long they interacted with the robot. Because the challenge is not losing weight  it's actually keeping it off. And the longer you could interact with one of these interventions  well that's indicative  potentially  of longer term success. So the first thing I want to look at is how long  how long did people interact with these systems. It turns out that people interacted with the robot significantly more  even though the quality of the advice was identical to the computer. When it asked people to rate it on terms of the quality of the working alliance  people rated the robot higher and they trusted the robot more. And when you look at emotional engagement  it was completely different. People would name the robots. They would dress the robots. And even when we would come up to pick up the robots at the end of the study  they would come out to the car and say good bye to the robots. They didn't do this with a computer. The last thing I want to talk about today is the future of children's media. We know that kids spend a lot of time behind screens today  whether it's television or computer games or whatnot. My sons  they love the screen. They love the screen. But I want them to play  as a mom  I want them to play  like  real world play. And so I have a new project in my group I wanted to present to you today called Playtime Computing that's really trying to think about how we can take what's so engaging about digital media and literally bring it off the screen into the real world of the child  where it can take on many of the properties of real world play. So here's the first exploration of this idea  where characters can be physical or virtual  and where the digital content can literally come off the screen into the world and back. I like to think of this as the Atari Pong of this blended reality play. But we can push this idea further. What if    CB     the character itself could come into your world  It turns out that kids love it when the character becomes real and enters into their world. And when it's in their world  they can relate to it and play with it in a way that's fundamentally different from how they play with it on the screen. Another important idea is this notion of persistence of character across realities. So changes that children make in the real world need to translate to the virtual world. So here  Nathan has changed the letter A to the number  . You can imagine maybe these symbols give the characters special powers when it goes into the virtual world. So they are now sending the character back into that world. And now it's got number power. And then finally  what I've been trying to do here is create a really immersive experience for kids  where they really feel like they are part of that story  a part of that experience. And I really want to spark their imaginations the way mine was sparked as a little girl watching  Star Wars.  But I want to do more than that. I actually want them to create those experiences. I want them to be able to literally build their imagination into these experiences and make them their own. So we've been exploring a lot of ideas in telepresence and mixed reality to literally allow kids to project their ideas into this space where other kids can interact with them and build upon them. I really want to come up with new ways of children's media that foster creativity and learning and innovation. I think that's very  very important. So this is a new project. We've invited a lot of kids into this space  and they think it's pretty cool. But I can tell you  the thing that they love the most is the robot. What they care about is the robot. Robots touch something deeply human within us. And so whether they're helping us to become creative and innovative  or whether they're helping us to feel more deeply connected despite distance  or whether they are our trusted sidekick who's helping us attain our personal goals in becoming our highest and best selves  for me  robots are all about people. Thank you. Hawa Abdi  Many people       years for Somalia     were  fighting. So there was no job  no food. Children  most of them  became very malnourished  like this. Deqo Mohamed  So as you know  always in a civil war  the ones affected most  are  the women and children. So our patients are women and children. And they are in our backyard. It's our home. We welcome them. That's the camp that we have in now        people  where    percent of them are women and children. Pat Mitchell  And this is your hospital. This is the inside. HA  We are doing C sections and different operations because people need some help. There is no government to protect them. DM  Every morning we have about     patients  maybe more or less. But sometimes we are only five doctors and    nurses  and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them. But we take the severe ones  and we reschedule the other ones the next day. It is very tough. And as you can see  it's the women who are carrying the children  it's the women who come into the hospitals  it's the women  are  building the houses. That's their house. And we have a school. This is our bright    we opened  in the  last two years  an  elementary school where we have     children  and the majority are women and girls. PM  And the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic. Would you explain the rules for admission  HA  The people who are coming to us  we are welcoming. We are sharing with them whatever we have. But there are only two rules. First rule  there is no clan distinguished and political division in Somali society.  Whomever  makes those things we throw out. The second  no man can beat his wife. If he beat  we will put  him  in jail  and we will call the eldest people. Until they identify this case  we'll never release him. That's our two rules. The other thing that I have realized  that the woman is the most strong person all over the world. Because the last    years  the Somali woman has stood up. They were the leaders  and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations. We are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war. We can reconcile. We can do everything. DM  As my mother said  we are the future hope  and the men are only killing in Somalia. So we came up with these two rules. In a camp with        people  you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights. So there is no clan division  and no man can beat his wife. And we have a little storage room where we converted a jail. So if you beat your wife  you're going to be there. So empowering the women and giving the opportunity    we are there for them. They are not alone for this. PM  You're running a medical clinic. It brought much  much needed medical care to people who wouldn't get it. You're also running a civil society. You've created your own rules  in which women and children are getting a different sense of security. Talk to me about your decision  Dr. Abdi  and your decision  Dr. Mohamed  to work together    for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances. HA  My age    because I was born in         we were having  at that time  government  law and order. But one day  I went to the hospital    my mother was sick    and I saw the hospital  how they  were  treating the doctors  how they  are  committed to help the sick people. I admired them  and I decided to become a doctor. My mother died  unfortunately  when I was    years  old . Then my father allowed me to proceed  with  my hope. My mother died in  a  gynecology complication  so I decided to become a gynecology specialist. That's why I became a doctor. So Dr. Deqo has to explain. DM  For me  my mother was preparing  me  when I was a child to become a doctor  but I really didn't want to. Maybe I should become an historian  or maybe a reporter. I loved it  but it didn't work. When the war broke out    civil war    I saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help  and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in Somalia and help the women and children. And I thought  maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist. So I went to Russia  and my mother also   during the  time of  the  Soviet Union. So some of our character  maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training. So that's how I decided  to do  the same. My sister was different. She's here. She's also a doctor. She graduated in Russia also. And to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war    when I was     and my sister was     when the civil war broke out. So it was the need and the people we saw in the early '  s    that's what made us go back and work for them. PM  So what is the biggest challenge working  mother and daughter  in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations  HA  Yes  I was working in a tough situation  very dangerous. And when I saw the people who needed me  I was staying with them to help  because I  could  do something for them. Most people fled abroad. But I remained with those people  and I was trying to do something     any  little thing I  could  do. I succeeded in my place. Now my place is        people who are respecting each other  who are not fighting. But we try to stand on our feet  to do something  little things  we can for our people. And I'm thankful for my daughters. When they come to me  they help me to treat the people  to help. They do everything for them. They have done what I desire to do for them. PM  What's the best part of working with your mother  and the most challenging part for you  DM  She's very tough  it's most challenging. She always expects us to do more. And really when you think  you  cannot do it  she will push you  and I can do it. That's the best part. She shows us  trains us how to do and how to be better  people  and how to do long hours in surgery        patients per day         surgeries  and still you have to manage the camp    that's how she trains us. It is not like beautiful offices here     patients  you're tired. You see     patients     surgeries and        people to manage. PM  But you do it for good reasons. Wait. Wait. HA  Thank you. DM  Thank you. HA  Thank you very much. DM  Thank you very much. I'd like to start with a couple of quick examples. These are spinneret glands on the abdomen of a spider. They produce six different types of silk  which is spun together into a fiber  tougher than any fiber humans have ever made. The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber. And to make that  it involves extremes of temperature  extremes of pressure and loads of pollution. And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure with raw materials of dead flies and water. It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn. This beetle can detect a forest fire at    kilometers away. That's roughly        times the range of man made fire detectors. And what's more  this guy doesn't need a wire connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels. So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver. If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does  we could achieve factor     factor      maybe even factor       savings in resource and energy use. And if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution  I believe there are three really big changes we need to bring about. Firstly  radical increases in resource efficiency. Secondly  shifting from a linear  wasteful  polluting way of using resources to a closed loop model. And thirdly  changing from a fossil fuel economy to a solar economy. And for all three of these  I believe  biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need. You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products  and all of those have benefited from a  .  billion year research and development period. And given that level of investment  it makes sense to use it. So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas. And let's start with radical increases in resource efficiency. When we were working on the Eden Project  we had to create a very large greenhouse in a site that was not only irregular  but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried. It was a hell of a challenge  and it was actually examples from biology that provided a lot of the clues. So for instance  it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form that would work regardless of the final ground levels. Studying pollen grains and radiolaria and carbon molecules helped us devise the most efficient structural solution using hexagons and pentagons. The next move was that we wanted to try and maximize the size of those hexagons. And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass  which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes. And in nature there are lots of examples of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes. So we started exploring this material called ETFE. It's a high strength polymer. And what you do is you put it together in three layers  you weld it around the edge  and then you inflate it. And the great thing about this stuff is you can make it in units of roughly seven times the size of glass  and it was only one percent of the weight of double glazing. So that was a factor     saving. And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle in which one breakthrough facilitated another. So with such large  lightweight pillows  we had much less steel. With less steel we were getting more sunlight in  which meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter. And with less overall weight in the superstructure  there were big savings in the foundations. And at the end of the project we worked out that the weight of that superstructure was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building. So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example of how ideas from biology can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency    delivering the same function  but with a fraction of the resource input. And actually there are loads of examples in nature that you could turn to for similar solutions. So for instance  you could develop super efficient roof structures based on giant Amazon water lilies  whole buildings inspired by abalone shells  super lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells. There's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here using nature as a design tool. So now I want to go onto talking about the linear to closed loop idea. The way we tend to use resources is we extract them  we turn them into short life products and then dispose of them. Nature works very differently. In ecosystems  the waste from one organism becomes the nutrient for something else in that system. And there are some examples of projects that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems. And one of my favorites is called the Cardboard to Caviar Project by Graham Wiles. And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants that were producing lots of food  cardboard and plastic waste. It was ending up in landfills. Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste. And I'm just going to talk through this animation. So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants. They then shredded the cardboard and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding. When that was soiled  they were paid again to collect it. They put it into worm recomposting systems  which produced a lot of worms  which they fed to Siberian sturgeon  which produced caviar  which they sold back to the restaurants. So it transformed a linear process into a closed loop model  and it created more value in the process. Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this  turning waste streams into schemes that create value. And just as natural systems tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time  there's a real sense with this project that the number of possibilities just continue increasing. And I know it's a quirky example  but I think the implications of this are quite radical  because it suggests that we could actually transform a big problem    waste    into a massive opportunity. And particularly in cities    we could look at the whole metabolism of cities  and look at those as opportunities. And that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about  the Mobius Project  where we're trying to bring together a number of activities  all within one building  so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another. And the kind of elements I'm talking about are  firstly  we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse  a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas. Then we would have an anaerobic digester  which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area  turn that into heat for the greenhouse and electricity to feed back into the grid. We'd have a water treatment system treating wastewater  turning that into fresh water and generating energy from the solids using just plants and micro organisms. We'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen and worms from the compost and supplying fish back to the restaurant. And we'd also have a coffee shop  and the waste grains from that could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms. So you can see that we're bringing together cycles of food  energy and water and waste all within one building. And just for fun  we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London  which at the moment is a complete eyesore. Some of you may recognize this. And with just a little bit of planning  we could transform a space dominated by traffic into one that provides open space for people  reconnects people with food and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities. So the final project I want to talk about is the Sahara Forest Project  which we're working on at the moment. It may come as a surprise to some of you to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert were actually forested a fairly short time ago. So for instance  when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa  huge areas of North Africa were covered in cedar and cypress forests. And during the evolution of life on the Earth  it was the colonization of the land by plants that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy. The converse is also true. The more vegetation we lose  the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change and lead to further desertification. And this animation  this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years  and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts shift quite a lot  and that raises the question of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions to halt  or maybe even reverse  desertification. And if you look at some of the organisms that have evolved to live in deserts  there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity. This is the Namibian fog basking beetle  and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert. The way it does this is it comes out at night  crawls to the top of a sand dune  and because it's got a matte black shell  is able to radiate heat out to the night sky and become slightly cooler than its surroundings. So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea  you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell. Just before sunrise  he tips his shell up  the water runs down into his mouth  has a good drink  goes off and hides for the rest of the day. And the ingenuity  if you could call it that  goes even further. Because if you look closely at the beetle's shell  there are lots of little bumps on that shell. And those bumps are hydrophilic  they attract water. Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water. And the effect of this is that as the droplets start to form on the bumps  they stay in tight  spherical beads  which means they're much more mobile than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell. So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air  it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth. So amazing example of an adaptation to a very resource constrained environment    and in that sense  very relevant to the kind of challenges we're going to be facing over the next few years  next few decades. We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse. This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions  and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills  and you trickle seawater over that so that wind blows through  it picks up a lot of moisture and is cooled in the process. So inside it's cool and humid  which means the plants need less water to grow. And then at the back of the greenhouse  it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle. And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built was it was producing slightly more freshwater than it needed for the plants inside. So they just started spreading this on the land around  and the combination of that and the elevated humidity had quite a dramatic effect on the local area. This photograph was taken on completion day  and just one year later  it looked like that. So it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building turning barren land back into biologically productive land    and in that sense  going beyond sustainable design to achieve restorative design. So we were keen to scale this up and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits. And when you think about nature  often you think about it as being all about competition. But actually in mature ecosystems  you're just as likely to find examples of symbiotic relationships. So an important biomimicry principle is to find ways of bringing technologies together in symbiotic clusters. And the technology that we settled on as an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse is concentrated solar power  which uses solar tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat to create electricity. And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP  consider that we receive        times as much energy from the sun every year as we use in energy from all forms           times. So our energy problems are not intractable. It's a challenge to our ingenuity. And the kind of synergies I'm talking about are  firstly  both these technologies work very well in hot  sunny deserts. CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater. That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces. CSP produces a lot of waste heat. We'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater and enhance the restorative benefits. And finally  in the shade under the mirrors  it's possible to grow all sorts of crops that would not grow in direct sunlight. So this is how this scheme would look. The idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind. We'd have concentrated solar power plants at intervals along the way. Some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts. And with biomimicry  if you've got an underutilized resource  you don't think   How am I going to dispose of this   You think   What can I add to the system to create more value   And it turns out that different things crystallize out at different stages. When you evaporate seawater  the first thing to crystallize out is calcium carbonate. And that builds up on the evaporators    and that's what that image on the left is    gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate. So after a while  we could take that out  use it as a lightweight building block. And if you think about the carbon in that  that would have come out of the atmosphere  into the sea and then locked away in a building product. The next thing is sodium chloride. You can also compress that into a building block  as they did here. This is a hotel in Bolivia. And then after that  there are all sorts of compounds and elements that we can extract  like phosphates  that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them. And there's just about every element of the periodic table in seawater. So it should be possible to extract valuable elements like lithium for high performance batteries. And in parts of the Arabian Gulf  the seawater  the salinity is increasing steadily due to the discharge of waste brine from desalination plants. And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse. Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine. We could evaporate it to enhance the restorative benefits and capture the salts  transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity. Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model for how we could create zero carbon food  abundant renewable energy in some of the most water stressed parts of the planet as well as reversing desertification in certain areas. So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning  radical increases in resource efficiency  closing loops and a solar economy. They're not just possible  they're critical. And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems will provide a lot of the solutions. But perhaps more than anything  what this thinking provides is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design. Far too much of the talk about the environment uses very negative language. But here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing. And this is an important point. Antoine de Saint Exupery once said   If you want to build a flotilla of ships  you don't sit around talking about carpentry. No  you need to set people's souls ablaze with visions of exploring distant shores.  And that's what we need to do  so let's be positive  and let's make progress with what could be the most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. That was whistling. I'm trying to do this in English. What is a chubby  curly haired guy from Holland    why is he whistling  Well actually  I've  been  whistling since the age of four  about four. My dad was always whistling around the house  and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. So I whistled along with him. And actually  till I was     I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling  because  to be honest  my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. I whistled alone. I whistled in the classroom. I whistled on  my  bike. I whistled everywhere. And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family in law. And they had some  in my opinion  terrible Christmas music. And when I hear music that I don't like  I try to make it better. So  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer     you know it  But it can also sound like this. But during a Christmas party    at dinner actually    it's very annoying. So my sister in law asked me a few times   Please stop whistling.  And I just couldn't. And at one point    and I had some wine  I have to admit that    at one point I said   If there was a contest  I would join.  And two weeks later I received a text message   You're going to America.  So  okay  I'm going to America. I would love to  but why  So I immediately called her up  of course. She Googled  and she found this World Whistling Championship in America  of course. She didn't expect me to go there. And I would have lost my face. I don't know if that's correct English. But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean. I lost my face. And she thought   He will never go there.  But actually I did. So I went to Louisburg  North Carolina  southeast United States  and I entered the world of whistling. And I also entered the world championship  and I won there in     . That was great fun  of course. And to defend my title    like judokas do and sportsmen    I thought  well let's go back in       and I won again. Then I couldn't participate for a few years. And in      I entered again in Japan  Tokyo  and I won again. So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam  in the beautiful city  on a big stage  and I'm talking about whistling. And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment. So I quit my day job as a nurse. And I try to live my dream    well  actually  it was never my dream  but it sounds so good. Okay  I'm not the only one whistling here. You say   Huh  what do you mean   Well actually  you are going to whistle along. And then always the same thing happens  people are watching each other and think   Oh  my God. Why  Can I go away   No  you can't. Actually it's very simple. The track that I will whistle is called  F te de la Belle.  It's about    minutes long. No  no  no. It's four minutes long. And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling. So I whistle the tone. Sorry. I forgot one thing. You whistle the same tone as me. I heard a wide variety of tones. This is very promising. This is very promising. I'll ask the technicians to start the music. And if it's started  I just point where you whistle along  and we will see what happens. Oh  hah. I'm so sorry  technicians. I'm so used to that. I start it myself. Okay  here it is. Okay. It's easy  isn't it  Now comes the solo. I propose I do that myself. Max Westerman  Geert Chatrou  the World Champion  of  Whistling. Geert Chatrou  Thank you. Thank you. We're here to celebrate compassion. But compassion  from my vantage point  has a problem. As essential as it is across our traditions  as real as so many of us know it to be in particular lives  the word  compassion  is hollowed out in our culture  and it is suspect in my field of journalism. It's seen as a squishy kumbaya thing  or it's seen as potentially depressing. Karen Armstrong has told what I think is an iconic story of giving a speech in Holland and  after the fact  the word  compassion  was translated as  pity.  Now compassion  when it enters the news  too often comes in the form of feel good feature pieces or sidebars about heroic people you could never be like or happy endings or examples of self sacrifice that would seem to be too good to be true most of the time. Our cultural imagination about compassion has been deadened by idealistic images. And so what I'd like to do this morning for the next few minutes is perform a linguistic resurrection. And I hope you'll come with me on my basic premise that words matter  that they shape the way we understand ourselves  the way we interpret the world and the way we treat others. When this country first encountered genuine diversity in the     s  we adopted tolerance as the core civic virtue with which we would approach that. Now the word  tolerance   if you look at it in the dictionary  connotes  allowing    indulging  and  enduring.  In the medical context that it comes from  it is about testing the limits of thriving in an unfavorable environment. Tolerance is not really a lived virtue  it's more of a cerebral ascent. And it's too cerebral to animate guts and hearts and behavior when the going gets rough. And the going is pretty rough right now. I think that without perhaps being able to name it  we are collectively experiencing that we've come as far as we can with tolerance as our only guiding virtue. Compassion is a worthy successor. It is organic  across our religious  spiritual and ethical traditions  and yet it transcends them. Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others  both in our private and in our civic spaces. So what is it  three dimensionally  What are its kindred and component parts  What's in its universe of attendant virtues  To start simply  I want to say that compassion is kind. Now  kindness  might sound like a very mild word  and it's prone to its own abundant cliche. But kindness is an everyday byproduct of all the great virtues. And it is a most edifying form of instant gratification. Compassion is also curious. Compassion cultivates and practices curiosity. I love a phrase that was offered me by two young women who are interfaith innovators in Los Angeles  Aziza Hasan and Malka Fenyvesi. They are working to create a new imagination about shared life among young Jews and Muslims  and as they do that  they cultivate what they call  curiosity without assumptions.  Well that's going to be a breeding ground for compassion. Compassion can be synonymous with empathy. It can be joined with the harder work of forgiveness and reconciliation  but it can also express itself in the simple act of presence. It's linked to practical virtues like generosity and hospitality and just being there  just showing up. I think that compassion also is often linked to beauty    and by that I mean a willingness to see beauty in the other  not just what it is about them that might need helping. I love it that my Muslim conversation partners often speak of beauty as a core moral value. And in that light  for the religious  compassion also brings us into the territory of mystery    encouraging us not just to see beauty  but perhaps also to look for the face of God in the moment of suffering  in the face of a stranger  in the face of the vibrant religious other. I'm not sure if I can show you what tolerance looks like  but I can show you what compassion looks like    because it is visible. When we see it  we recognize it and it changes the way we think about what is doable  what is possible. It is so important when we're communicating big ideas    but especially a big spiritual idea like compassion    to root it as we present it to others in space and time and flesh and blood    the color and complexity of life. And compassion does seek physicality. I first started to learn this most vividly from Matthew Sanford. And I don't imagine that you will realize this when you look at this photograph of him  but he's paraplegic. He's been paralyzed from the waist down since he was     in a car crash that killed his father and his sister. Matthew's legs don't work  and he'll never walk again  and    and he does experience this as an  and  rather than a  but     and he experiences himself to be healed and whole. And as a teacher of yoga  he brings that experience to others across the spectrum of ability and disability  health  illness and aging. He says that he's just at an extreme end of the spectrum we're all on. He's doing some amazing work now with veterans coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. And Matthew has made this remarkable observation that I'm just going to offer you and let it sit. I can't quite explain it  and he can't either. But he says that he has yet to experience someone who became more aware of their body  in all its frailty and its grace  without  at the same time  becoming more compassionate towards all of life. Compassion also looks like this. This is Jean Vanier. Jean Vanier helped found the L'Arche communities  which you can now find all over the world  communities centered around life with people with mental disabilities    mostly Down syndrome. The communities that Jean Vanier founded  like Jean Vanier himself  exude tenderness.  Tender  is another word I would love to spend some time resurrecting. We spend so much time in this culture being driven and aggressive  and I spend a lot of time being those things too. And compassion can also have those qualities. But again and again  lived compassion brings us back to the wisdom of tenderness. Jean Vanier says that his work  like the work of other people    his great  beloved  late friend Mother Teresa    is never in the first instance about changing the world  it's in the first instance about changing ourselves. He's says that what they do with L'Arche is not a solution  but a sign. Compassion is rarely a solution  but it is always a sign of a deeper reality  of deeper human possibilities. And compassion is unleashed in wider and wider circles by signs and stories  never by statistics and strategies. We need those things too  but we're also bumping up against their limits. And at the same time that we are doing that  I think we are rediscovering the power of story    that as human beings  we need stories to survive  to flourish  to change. Our traditions have always known this  and that is why they have always cultivated stories at their heart and carried them forward in time for us. There is  of course  a story behind the key moral longing and commandment of Judaism to repair the world    tikkun olam. And I'll never forget hearing that story from Dr. Rachel Naomi Remen  who told it to me as her grandfather told it to her  that in the beginning of the Creation something happened and the original light of the universe was shattered into countless pieces. It lodged as shards inside every aspect of the Creation. And that the highest human calling is to look for this light  to point at it when we see it  to gather it up  and in so doing  to repair the world. Now this might sound like a fanciful tale. Some of my fellow journalists might interpret it that way. Rachel Naomi Remen says this is an important and empowering story for our time  because this story insists that each and every one of us  frail and flawed as we may be  inadequate as we may feel  has exactly what's needed to help repair the part of the world that we can see and touch. Stories like this  signs like this  are practical tools in a world longing to bring compassion to abundant images of suffering that can otherwise overwhelm us. Rachel Naomi Remen is actually bringing compassion back to its rightful place alongside science in her field of medicine in the training of new doctors. And this trend of what Rachel Naomi Remen is doing  how these kinds of virtues are finding a place in the vocabulary of medicine    the work Fred Luskin is doing    I think this is one of the most fascinating developments of the   st century    that science  in fact  is taking a virtue like compassion definitively out of the realm of idealism. This is going to change science  I believe  and it will change religion. But here's a face from   th century science that might surprise you in a discussion about compassion. We all know about the Albert Einstein who came up with E   mc . We don't hear so much about the Einstein who invited the African American opera singer  Marian Anderson  to stay in his home when she came to sing in Princeton because the best hotel there was segregated and wouldn't have her. We don't hear about the Einstein who used his celebrity to advocate for political prisoners in Europe or the Scottsboro boys in the American South. Einstein believed deeply that science should transcend national and ethnic divisions. But he watched physicists and chemists become the purveyors of weapons of mass destruction in the early   th century. He once said that science in his generation had become like a razor blade in the hands of a three year old. And Einstein foresaw that as we grow more modern and technologically advanced  we need the virtues our traditions carry forward in time more  not less. He liked to talk about the spiritual geniuses of the ages. Some of his favorites were Moses  Jesus  Buddha  St. Francis of Assisi  Gandhi    he adored his contemporary  Gandhi. And Einstein said    and I think this is a quote  again  that has not been passed down in his legacy    that  these kinds of people are geniuses in the art of living  more necessary to the dignity  security and joy of humanity than the discoverers of objective knowledge.  Now invoking Einstein might not seem the best way to bring compassion down to earth and make it seem accessible to all the rest of us  but actually it is. I want to show you the rest of this photograph  because this photograph is analogous to what we do to the word  compassion  in our culture    we clean it up and we diminish its depths and its grounding in life  which is messy. So in this photograph you see a mind looking out a window at what might be a cathedral    it's not. This is the full photograph  and you see a middle aged man wearing a leather jacket  smoking a cigar. And by the look of that paunch  he hasn't been doing enough yoga. We put these two photographs side by side on our website  and someone said   When I look at the first photo  I ask myself  what was he thinking  And when I look at the second  I ask  what kind of person was he  What kind of man is this   Well  he was complicated. He was incredibly compassionate in some of his relationships and terribly inadequate in others. And it is much harder  often  to be compassionate towards those closest to us  which is another quality in the universe of compassion  on its dark side  that also deserves our serious attention and illumination. Gandhi  too  was a real flawed human being. So was Martin Luther King  Jr. So was Dorothy Day. So was Mother Teresa. So are we all. And I want to say that it is a liberating thing to realize that that is no obstacle to compassion    following on what Fred Luskin says    that these flaws just make us human. Our culture is obsessed with perfection and with hiding problems. But what a liberating thing to realize that our problems  in fact  are probably our richest sources for rising to this ultimate virtue of compassion  towards bringing compassion towards the suffering and joys of others. Rachel Naomi Remen is a better doctor because of her life long struggle with Crohn's disease. Einstein became a humanitarian  not because of his exquisite knowledge of space and time and matter  but because he was a Jew as Germany grew fascist. And Karen Armstrong  I think you would also say that it was some of your very wounding experiences in a religious life that  with a zigzag  have led to the Charter for Compassion. Compassion can't be reduced to sainthood any more than it can be reduced to pity. So I want to propose a final definition of compassion    this is Einstein with Paul Robeson by the way    and that would be for us to call compassion a spiritual technology. Now our traditions contain vast wisdom about this  and we need them to mine it for us now. But compassion is also equally at home in the secular as in the religious. So I will paraphrase Einstein in closing and say that humanity  the future of humanity  needs this technology as much as it needs all the others that have now connected us and set before us the terrifying and wondrous possibility of actually becoming one human race. Thank you. I want you to take a look at this baby. What you're drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch. But today I'm going to talk to you about something you can't see    what's going on up in that little brain of hers. The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what's going on up there is nothing short of rocket science. And what we're learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the  celestial openness  of the child's mind. What we see here is a mother in India  and she's speaking Koro  which is a newly discovered language. And she's talking to her baby. What this mother    and the     people who speak Koro in the world    understands  is  that  to preserve this language  they need to speak it to the babies. And therein lies a critical puzzle. Why is it that you can't preserve a language by speaking to you and I  to the adults  Well  it's got to do with your brain. What we see here is that language has a critical period for learning. The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis. And you'll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language. Babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven  and then there's a systematic decline. After puberty  we fall off the map. No scientists dispute this curve  but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way. Work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development    and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language. We think  by studying how the sounds are learned  we'll have a model for the rest of language  and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social  emotional and cognitive development. So we've been studying the babies using a technique that we're using all over the world and the sounds of all languages. The baby sits on a parent's lap  and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes    like from  ah  to  ee.  If they do so at the appropriate time  the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum. A six monther adores the task. What have we learned  Well  babies all over the world are what I like to describe as  citizens of the world.  They can discriminate all the sounds of all languages  no matter what country we're testing and what language we're using  and that's remarkable because you and I can't do that. We're culture bound listeners. We can discriminate the sounds of our own language  but not those of foreign languages. So the question arises  when do those citizens of the world turn into the language bound listeners that we are  And the answer  before their first birthdays. What you see here is performance on that head turn task for babies tested in Tokyo and the United States  here in Seattle  as they listened to  ra  and  la     sounds important to English  but not to Japanese. So at six to eight months the babies are totally equivalent. Two months later something incredible occurs. The babies in the United States are getting a lot better  babies in Japan are getting a lot worse  but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn. So the question is  what's happening during this critical two month period  This is the critical period for sound development  but what's going on up there  So there are two things going on. The first is that the babies are listening intently to us  and they're taking statistics as they listen to us talk    they're taking statistics. So listen to two mothers speaking motherese    the universal language we use when we talk to kids    first in English and then in Japanese. so pretty and nice. Japanese Mother   Japanese  Patricia Kuhl  During the production of speech  when babies listen  what they're doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear. And those distributions grow. And what we've learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics  and the statistics of Japanese and English are very  very different. English has a lot of Rs and Ls. The distribution shows. And the distribution of Japanese is totally different  where we see a group of intermediate sounds  which is known as the Japanese  R.  So babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains  it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture bound listeners that we are. But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics. We're governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development. So what we're seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about. We're arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize. It's raising lots of questions about bilingual people. Bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once and flip between them  one after the other  depending on who they're speaking to. So we asked ourselves  can the babies take statistics on a brand new language  And we tested this by exposing American babies who'd never heard a second language to Mandarin for the first time during the critical period. We knew that  when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle on the Mandarin sounds  they showed the same pattern. Six to eight months  they're totally equivalent. Two months later  something incredible happens. But the Taiwanese babies are getting better  not the American babies. What we did was expose American babies during this period to Mandarin. It was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for    sessions. Here's what it looked like in the laboratory. PK  So what have we done to their little brains  We had to run a control group to make sure that just coming into the laboratory didn't improve your Mandarin skills. So a group of babies came in and listened to English. And we can see from the graph that exposure to English didn't improve their Mandarin. But look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for    sessions. They were as good as the babies in Taiwan who'd been listening for    and a half months. What it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language. Whatever you put in front of them  they'll take statistics on. But we wondered what role the human being played in this learning exercise. So we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage  the same    sessions  but over a television set and another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen. What did we do to their brains  What you see here is the audio result    no learning whatsoever    and the video result    no learning whatsoever. It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics. The social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics. We want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of televisions  as opposed to in front of human beings. Thankfully  we have a new machine  magnetoencephalography  that allows us to do this. It looks like a hair dryer from Mars. But it's completely safe  completely non invasive and silent. We're looking at millimeter accuracy with regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy using     SQUIDs    these are Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices    to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking. We're the first in the world to record babies in an MEG machine while they are learning. So this is little Emma. She's a six monther. And she's listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears. You can see  she can move around. We're tracking her head with little pellets in a cap  so she's free to move completely unconstrained. It's a technical tour de force. What are we seeing  We're seeing the baby brain. As the baby hears a word in her language the auditory areas light up  and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence  getting the brain coordinated with its different areas  and causality  one brain area causing another to activate. We are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child's brain development. We're going to be able to see a child's brain as they experience an emotion  as they learn to speak and read  as they solve a math problem  as they have an idea. And we're going to be able to invent brain based interventions for children who have difficulty learning. Just as the poets and writers described  we're going to be able to see  I think  that wondrous openness  utter and complete openness  of the mind of a child. In investigating the child's brain  we're going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human  and in the process  we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives. Thank you. I've been spending a lot of time traveling around the world these days  talking to groups of students and professionals  and everywhere I'm finding that I hear similar themes. On the one hand  people say   The time for change is now.  They want to be part of it. They talk about wanting lives of purpose and greater meaning. But on the other hand  I hear people talking about fear  a sense of risk aversion. They say   I really want to follow a life of purpose  but I don't know where to start. I don't want to disappoint my family or friends.  I work in global poverty. And they say   I want to work in global poverty  but what will it mean about my career  Will I be marginalized  Will I not make enough money  Will I never get married or have children   And as a woman who didn't get married until I was a lot older    and I'm glad I waited       and has no children  I look at these young people and I say   Your job is not to be perfect. Your job is only to be human. And nothing important happens in life without a cost.  These conversations really reflect what's happening at the national and international level. Our leaders and ourselves want everything  but we don't talk about the costs. We don't talk about the sacrifice. One of my favorite quotes from literature was written by Tillie Olsen  the great American writer from the South. In a short story called  Oh Yes   she talks about a white woman in the     s who has a daughter who befriends a little African American girl  and she looks at her child with a sense of pride  but she also wonders  what price will she pay   Better immersion than to live untouched.  But the real question is  what is the cost of not daring  What is the cost of not trying  I've been so privileged in my life to know extraordinary leaders who have chosen to live lives of immersion. One woman I knew who was a fellow at a program that I ran at the Rockefeller Foundation was named Ingrid Washinawatok. She was a leader of the Menominee tribe  a Native American peoples. And when we would gather as fellows  she would push us to think about how the elders in Native American culture make decisions. And she said they would literally visualize the faces of children for seven generations into the future  looking at them from the Earth  and they would look at them  holding them as stewards for that future. Ingrid understood that we are connected to each other  not only as human beings  but to every living thing on the planet. And tragically  in       when she was in Colombia working with the U'wa people  focused on preserving their culture and language  she and two colleagues were abducted and tortured and killed by the FARC. And whenever we would gather the fellows after that  we would leave a chair empty for her spirit. And more than a decade later  when I talk to NGO fellows  whether in Trenton  New Jersey or the office of the White House  and we talk about Ingrid  they all say that they're trying to integrate her wisdom and her spirit and really build on the unfulfilled work of her life's mission. And when we think about legacy  I can think of no more powerful one  despite how short her life was. And I've been touched by Cambodian women    beautiful women  women who held the tradition of the classical dance in Cambodia. And I met them in the early '  s. In the     s  under the Pol Pot regime  the Khmer Rouge killed over a million people  and they focused and targeted the elites and the intellectuals  the artists  the dancers. And at the end of the war  there were only    of these classical dancers still living. And the women  who I was so privileged to meet when there were three survivors  told these stories about lying in their cots in the refugee camps. They said they would try so hard to remember the fragments of the dance  hoping that others were alive and doing the same. And one woman stood there with this perfect carriage  her hands at her side  and she talked about the reunion of the    after the war and how extraordinary it was. And these big tears fell down her face  but she never lifted her hands to move them. And the women decided that they would train not the next generation of girls  because they had grown too old already  but the next generation. And I sat there in the studio watching these women clapping their hands    beautiful rhythms    as these little fairy pixies were dancing around them  wearing these beautiful silk colors. And I thought  after all this atrocity  this is how human beings really pray. Because they're focused on honoring what is most beautiful about our past and building it into the promise of our future. And what these women understood is sometimes the most important things that we do and that we spend our time on are those things that we cannot measure. I also have been touched by the dark side of power and leadership. And I have learned that power  particularly in its absolute form  is an equal opportunity provider. In       I moved to Rwanda  and I worked with a very small group of Rwandan women to start that country's first microfinance bank. And one of the women was Agnes    there on your extreme left    she was one of the first three women parliamentarians in Rwanda  and her legacy should have been to be one of the mothers of Rwanda. We built this institution based on social justice  gender equity  this idea of empowering women. But Agnes cared more about the trappings of power than she did principle at the end. And though she had been part of building a liberal party  a political party that was focused on diversity and tolerance  about three months before the genocide  she switched parties and joined the extremist party  Hutu Power  and she became the Minister of Justice under the genocide regime and was known for inciting men to kill faster and stop behaving like women. She was convicted of category one crimes of genocide. And I would visit her in the prisons  sitting side by side  knees touching  and I would have to admit to myself that monsters exist in all of us  but that maybe it's not monsters so much  but the broken parts of ourselves  sadnesses  secret shame  and that ultimately it's easy for demagogues to prey on those parts  those fragments  if you will  and to make us look at other beings  human beings  as lesser than ourselves    and in the extreme  to do terrible things. And there is no group more vulnerable to those kinds of manipulations than young men. I've heard it said that the most dangerous animal on the planet is the adolescent male. And so in a gathering where we're focused on women  while it is so critical that we invest in our girls and we even the playing field and we find ways to honor them  we have to remember that the girls and the women are most isolated and violated and victimized and made invisible in those very societies where our men and our boys feel disempowered  unable to provide. And that  when they sit on those street corners and all they can think of in the future is no job  no education  no possibility  well then it's easy to understand how the greatest source of status can come from a uniform and a gun. Sometimes very small investments can release enormous  infinite potential that exists in all of us. One of the Acumen Fund fellows at my organization  Suraj Sudhakar  has what we call moral imagination    the ability to put yourself in another person's shoes and lead from that perspective. And he's been working with this young group of men who come from the largest slum in the world  Kibera. And they're incredible guys. And together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums  and they're reading many TED authors and liking it. And then they created a business plan competition. Then they decided that they would do TEDx's. And I have learned so much from Chris and Kevin and Alex and Herbert and all of these young men. Alex  in some ways  said it best. He said   We used to feel like nobodies  but now we feel like somebodies.  And I think we have it all wrong when we think that income is the link. What we really yearn for as human beings is to be visible to each other. And the reason these young guys told me that they're doing these TEDx's is because they were sick and tired of the only workshops coming to the slums being those workshops focused on HIV  or at best  microfinance. And they wanted to celebrate what's beautiful about Kibera and Mathare    the photojournalists and the creatives  the graffiti artists  the teachers and the entrepreneurs. And they're doing it. And my hat's off to you in Kibera. My own work focuses on making philanthropy more effective and capitalism more inclusive. At Acumen Fund  we take philanthropic resources and we invest what we call patient capital    money that will invest in entrepreneurs who see the poor not as passive recipients of charity  but as full bodied agents of change who want to solve their own problems and make their own decisions. We leave our money for    to    years  and when we get it back  we invest in other innovations that focus on change. I know it works. We've invested more than    million dollars in    companies  and those companies have brought another     million dollars into these forgotten markets. This year alone  they've delivered    million services like maternal health care and housing  emergency services  solar energy  so that people can have more dignity in solving their problems. Patient capital is uncomfortable for people searching for simple solutions  easy categories  because we don't see profit as a blunt instrument. But we find those entrepreneurs who put people and the planet before profit. And ultimately  we want to be part of a movement that is about measuring impact  measuring what is most important to us. And my dream is we'll have a world one day where we don't just honor those who take money and make more money from it  but we find those individuals who take our resources and convert it into changing the world in the most positive ways. And it's only when we honor them and celebrate them and give them status that the world will really change. Last May I had this extraordinary    hour period where I saw two visions of the world living side by side    one based on violence and the other on transcendence. I happened to be in Lahore  Pakistan on the day that two mosques were attacked by suicide bombers. And the reason these mosques were attacked is because the people praying inside were from a particular sect of Islam who fundamentalists don't believe are fully Muslim. And not only did those suicide bombers take a hundred lives  but they did more  because they created more hatred  more rage  more fear and certainly despair. But less than    hours  I was    miles away from those mosques  visiting one of our Acumen investees  an incredible man  Jawad Aslam  who dares to live a life of immersion. Born and raised in Baltimore  he studied real estate  worked in commercial real estate  and after      decided he was going to Pakistan to make a difference. For two years  he hardly made any money  a tiny stipend  but he apprenticed with this incredible housing developer named Tasneem Saddiqui. And he had a dream that he would build a housing community on this barren piece of land using patient capital  but he continued to pay a price. He stood on moral ground and refused to pay bribes. It took almost two years just to register the land. But I saw how the level of moral standard can rise from one person's action. Today        people live in     houses in this beautiful community. And there's schools and clinics and shops. But there's only one mosque. And so I asked Jawad   How do you guys navigate  This is a really diverse community. Who gets to use the mosque on Fridays   He said   Long story. It was hard  it was a difficult road  but ultimately the leaders of the community came together  realizing we only have each other. And we decided that we would elect the three most respected imams  and those imams would take turns  they would rotate who would say Friday prayer. But the whole community  all the different sects  including Shi'a and Sunni  would sit together and pray.  We need that kind of moral leadership and courage in our worlds. We face huge issues as a world    the financial crisis  global warming and this growing sense of fear and otherness. And every day we have a choice. We can take the easier road  the more cynical road  which is a road based on sometimes dreams of a past that never really was  a fear of each other  distancing and blame. Or we can take the much more difficult path of transformation  transcendence  compassion and love  but also accountability and justice. I had the great honor of working with the child psychologist Dr. Robert Coles  who stood up for change during the Civil Rights movement in the United States. And he tells this incredible story about working with a little six year old girl named Ruby Bridges  the first child to desegregate schools in the South    in this case  New Orleans. And he said that every day this six year old  dressed in her beautiful dress  would walk with real grace through a phalanx of white people screaming angrily  calling her a monster  threatening to poison her    distorted faces. And every day he would watch her  and it looked like she was talking to the people. And he would say   Ruby  what are you saying   And she'd say   I'm not talking.  And finally he said   Ruby  I see that you're talking. What are you saying   And she said   Dr. Coles  I am not talking  I'm praying.  And he said   Well  what are you praying   And she said   I'm praying  'Father  forgive them  for they know not what they are doing.'  At age six  this child was living a life of immersion  and her family paid a price for it. But she became part of history and opened up this idea that all of us should have access to education. My final story is about a young  beautiful man named Josephat Byaruhanga  who was another Acumen Fund fellow  who hails from Uganda  a farming community. And we placed him in a company in Western Kenya  just     miles away. And he said to me at the end of his year   Jacqueline  it was so humbling  because I thought as a farmer and as an African I would understand how to transcend culture. But especially when I was talking to the African women  I sometimes made these mistakes    it was so hard for me to learn how to listen.  And he said   So I conclude that  in many ways  leadership is like a panicle of rice. Because at the height of the season  at the height of its powers  it's beautiful  it's green  it nourishes the world  it reaches to the heavens.  And he said   But right before the harvest  it bends over with great gratitude and humility to touch the earth from where it came.  We need leaders. We ourselves need to lead from a place that has the audacity to believe we can  ourselves  extend the fundamental assumption that all men are created equal to every man  woman and child on this planet. And we need to have the humility to recognize that we cannot do it alone. Robert Kennedy once said that  few of us have the greatness to bend history itself  but each of us can work to change a small portion of events.  And it is in the total of all those acts that the history of this generation will be written. Our lives are so short  and our time on this planet is so precious  and all we have is each other. So may each of you live lives of immersion. They won't necessarily be easy lives  but in the end  it is all that will sustain us. Thank you. I'm speaking to you about what I call the  mesh.  It's essentially a fundamental shift in our relationship with stuff  with the things in our lives. And it's starting to look at    not always and not for everything    but in certain moments of time  access to certain kinds of goods and service will trump ownership of them. And so it's the pursuit of better things  easily shared. And we come from a long tradition of sharing. We've shared transportation. We've shared wine and food and other sorts of fabulous experiences in coffee bars in Amsterdam. We've also shared other sorts of entertainment    sports arenas  public parks  concert halls  libraries  universities. All these things are share platforms  but sharing ultimately starts and ends with what I refer to as the  mother of all share platforms.  And as I think about the mesh and I think about  well  what's driving it  how come it's happening now  I think there's a number of vectors that I want to give you as background. One is the recession    that the recession has caused us to rethink our relationship with the things in our lives relative to the value    so starting to align the value with the true cost. Secondly  population growth and density into cities. More people  smaller spaces  less stuff. Climate change  we're trying to reduce the stress in our personal lives and in our communities and on the planet. Also  there's been this recent distrust of big brands  global big brands  in a bunch of different industries  and that's created an opening. Research is showing here  in the States  and in Canada and Western Europe  that most of us are much more open to local companies  or brands that maybe we haven't heard of. Whereas before  we went with the big brands that we were sure we trusted. And last is that we're more connected now to more people on the planet than ever before    except for if you're sitting next to someone. The other thing that's worth considering is that we've made a huge investment over decades and decades  and tens of billions of dollars have gone into this investment that now is our inheritance. It's a physical infrastructure that allows us to get from point A to point B and move things that way. It's also    Web and mobile allow us to be connected and create all kinds of platforms and systems  and the investment of those technologies and that infrastructure is really our inheritance. It allows us to engage in really new and interesting ways. And so for me  a mesh company  the  classic  mesh company  brings together these three things  our ability to connect to each other    most of us are walking around with these mobile devices that are GPS enabled and Web enabled    allows us to find each other and find things in time and space. And third is that physical things are readable on a map    so restaurants  a variety of venues  but also with GPS and other technology like RFID and it continues to expand beyond that  we can also track things that are moving  like a car  a taxicab  a transit system  a box that's moving through time and space. And so that sets up for making access to get goods and services more convenient and less costly in many cases than owning them. For example  I want to use Zipcar. How many people here have experienced car sharing or bike sharing  Wow  that's great. Okay  thank you. Basically Zipcar is the largest car sharing company in the world. They did not invent car sharing. Car sharing was actually invented in Europe. One of the founders went to Switzerland  saw it implemented someplace  said   Wow  that looks really cool. I think we can do that in Cambridge   brought it to Cambridge and they started    two women    Robin Chase being the other person who started it. Zipcar got some really important things right. First  they really understood that a brand is a voice and a product is a souvenir. And so they were very clever about the way that they packaged car sharing. They made it sexy. They made it fresh. They made it aspirational. If you were a member of the club  when you're a member of a club  you're a Zipster. The cars they picked didn't look like ex cop cars that were hollowed out or something. They picked these sexy cars. They targeted to universities. They made sure that the demographic for who they were targeting and the car was all matching. It was a very nice experience  and the cars were clean and reliable  and it all worked. And so from a branding perspective  they got a lot right. But they understood fundamentally that they are not a car company. They understand that they are an information company. Because when we buy a car we go to the dealer once  we have an interaction  and we're chow    usually as quickly as possible. But when you're sharing a car and you have a car share service  you might use an E.V. to commute  you get a truck because you're doing a home project. When you pick your aunt up at the airport  you get a sedan. And you're going to the mountains to ski  you get different accessories put on the car for doing that sort of thing. Meanwhile  these guys are sitting back  collecting all sorts of data about our behavior and how we interact with the service. And so it's not only an option for them  but I believe it's an imperative for Zipcar and other mesh companies to actually just wow us  to be like a concierge service. Because we give them so much information  and they are entitled to really see how it is that we're moving. They're in really good shape to anticipate what we're going to want next. And so what percent of the day do you think the average person uses a car  What percentage of the time  Any guesses  Those are really very good. I was imagining it was like    percent when I first started. The number across the U.S. and Western Europe is eight percent. And so basically even if you think it's    percent     percent of the time  something that costs us a lot of money    personally  and also we organize our cities around it and all sorts of things       percent of the time it's sitting around. So for this reason  I think one of the other themes with the mesh is essentially that  if we squeeze hard on things that we've thrown away  there's a lot of value in those things. What set up with Zipcar    Zipcar started in     . In the last year        two car companies started  one that's in the U.K. called WhipCar  and the other one  RelayRides  in the U.S. They're both peer to peer car sharing services  because the two things that really work for car sharing is  one  the car has to be available  and two  it's within one or two blocks of where you stand. Well the car that's one or two blocks from your home or your office is probably your neighbor's car  and it's probably also available. So people have created this business. Zipcar started a decade earlier  in     . It took them six years to get       cars in service. WhipCar  which started April of last year  it took them six months to get       cars in the service. So  really interesting. People are making anywhere between     and     dollars a month letting their neighbors use their car when they're not using it. So it's like vacation rentals for cars. Since I'm here    and I hope some people in the audience are in the car business       I'm thinking that  coming from the technology side of things    we saw cable ready TVs and WiFi ready Notebooks    it would be really great if  any minute now  you guys could start rolling share ready cars off. Because it just creates more flexibility. It allows us as owners to have other options. And I think we're going there anyway. The opportunity and the challenge with mesh businesses    and those are businesses like Zipcar or Netflix that are full mesh businesses  or other ones where you have a lot of the car companies  car manufacturers  who are beginning to offer their own car share services as well as a second flanker brand  or as really a test  I think    is to make sharing irresistible. We have experiences in our lives  certainly  when sharing has been irresistible. It's just  how do we make that recurrent and scale it  We know also  because we're connected in social networks  that it's easy to create delight in one little place. It's contagious because we're all connected to each other. So if I have a terrific experience and I tweet it  or I tell five people standing next to me  news travels. The opposite  as we know  is also true  often more true. So here we have LudoTruck  which is in L.A.  doing the things that gourmet food trucks do  and they've gathered quite a following. In general  and maybe  again  it's because I'm a tech entrepreneur  I look at things as platforms. Platforms are invitations. So creating Craigslist or iTunes and the iPhone developer network  there are all these networks    Facebook as well. These platforms invite all sorts of developers and all sorts of people to come with their ideas and their opportunity to create and target an application for a particular audience. And honestly  it's full of surprises. Because I don't think any of us in this room could have predicted the sorts of applications that have happened at Facebook  around Facebook  for example  two years ago  when Mark announced that they were going to go with a platform. So in this way  I think that cities are platforms  and certainly Detroit is a platform. The invitation of bringing makers and artists and entrepreneurs    it really helps stimulate this fiery creativity and helps a city to thrive. It's inviting participation  and cities have  historically  invited all sorts of participation. Now we're saying that there's other options as well. So  for example  city departments can open up transit data. Google has made available transit data API. And so there's about seven or eight cities already in the U.S. that have provided the transit data  and different developers are building applications. So I was having a coffee in Portland  and half of a latte in and the little board in the cafe all of a sudden starts showing me that the next bus is coming in three minutes and the train is coming in    minutes. And so it's reliable  real data that's right in my face  where I am  so I can finish the latte. There's this fabulous opportunity we have across the U.S. now  about    percent of vacant commercial and industrial space. That space is not vital. The areas around it lack vitality and vibrancy and engagement. There's this thing    how many people here have heard of pop up stores or pop up shops  Oh  great. So I'm a big fan of this. And this is a very mesh y thing. Essentially  there are all sorts of restaurants in Oakland  near where I live. There's a pop up general store every three weeks  and they do a fantastic job of making a very social event happening for foodies. Super fun  and it happens in a very transitional neighborhood. Subsequent to that  after it's been going for about a year now  they actually started to lease and create and extend. An area that was edgy artsy is now starting to become much cooler and engage a lot more people. So this is an example. The Crafty Fox is this woman who's into crafts  and she does these pop up crafts fairs around London. But these sorts of things are happening in many different environments. From my perspective  one of the things pop up stores do is create perishability and urgency. It creates two of the favorite words of any businessperson  sold out. And the opportunity to really focus trust and attention is a wonderful thing. So a lot of what we see in the mesh  and a lot of what we have in the platform that we built allows us to define  refine and scale. It allows us to test things as an entrepreneur  to go to market  to be in conversation with people  listen  refine something and go back. It's very cost effective  and it's very mesh y. The infrastructure enables that. In closing  and as we're moving towards the end  I just also want to encourage    and I'm willing to share my failures as well  though not from the stage. I would just like to say that one of the big things  when we look at waste and when we look at ways that we can really be generous and contribute to each other  but also move to create a better economic situation and a better environmental situation  is by sharing failures. And one quick example is Velib  in       came forward in Paris with a very bold proposition  a very big bike sharing service. They made a lot of mistakes. They had some number of big successes. But they were very transparent  or they had to be  in the way that they exposed what worked and didn't work. And so B.C. in Barcelona and B cycle and Boris Bikes in London    no one has had to repeat the version  .  screw ups and expensive learning exercises that happened in Paris. So the opportunity when we're connected is also to share failures and successes. We're at the very beginning of something that  what we're seeing and the way that mesh companies are coming forward  is inviting  it's engaging  but it's very early. I have a website    it's a directory    and it started with about       companies  and in the last two and a half months it's up to about       companies. And it grows on a very regular daily basis. But it's very much at the beginning. So I just want to welcome all of you onto the ride. And thank you very much. Pat Mitchell  What is the story of this pin  Madeleine Albright  This is  Breaking the Glass Ceiling.  PM  Oh. That was well chosen  I would say  for TEDWomen. MA  Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen. And none of this pin stuff would have happened if it hadn't been for Saddam Hussein. I'll tell you what happened. I went to the United Nations as an ambassador  and it was after the Gulf War  and I was an instructed ambassador. And the cease fire had been translated into a series of sanctions resolutions  and my instructions were to say perfectly terrible things about Saddam Hussein constantly  which he deserved    he had invaded another country. And so all of a sudden  a poem appeared in the papers in Baghdad comparing me to many things  but among them an  unparalleled serpent.  And so I happened to have a snake pin. So I wore it when we talked about Iraq. And when I went out to meet the press  they zeroed in  said   Why are you wearing that snake pin   I said   Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent.  And then I thought  well this is fun. So I went out and I bought a lot of pins that would  in fact  reflect what I thought we were going to do on any given day. So that's how it all started. PM  So how large is the collection  MA  Pretty big. It's now traveling. At the moment it's in Indianapolis  but it was at the Smithsonian. And it goes with a book that says   Read My Pins.  PM  So is this a good idea. I remember when you were the first woman as Secretary of State  and there was a lot of conversation always about what you were wearing  how you looked    the thing that happens to a lot of women  especially if they're the first in a position. So how do you feel about that    the whole    MA  Well  it's pretty irritating actually because nobody ever describes what a man is wearing. But people did pay attention to what clothes I had. What was interesting was that  before I went up to New York as U.N. ambassador  I talked to Jeane Kirkpatrick  who'd been ambassador before me  and she said   You've got to get rid of your professor clothes. Go out and look like a diplomat.  So that did give me a lot of opportunities to go shopping. But still  there were all kinds of questions about     did you wear a hat    How short was your skirt   And one of the things    if you remember Condoleezza Rice was at some event and she wore boots  and she got criticized over that. And no guy ever gets criticized. But that's the least of it. PM  It is  for all of us  men and women  finding our ways of defining our roles  and doing them in ways that make a difference in the world and shape the future. How did you handle that balance between being the tough diplomatic and strong voice of this country to the rest of the world and also how you felt about yourself as a mother  a grandmother  nurturing ... and so how did you handle that  MA  Well the interesting part was I was asked what it was like to be the first woman Secretary of State a few minutes after I'd been named. And I said   Well I've been a woman for    years  but I've only been Secretary of State for a few minutes.  So it evolved. But basically I love being a woman. And so what happened    and I think there will probably be some people in the audience that will identify with this    I went to my first meeting  first at the U.N.  and that's when this all started  because that is a very male organization. And I'm sitting there    there are    members of the Security Council    so    men sat there staring at me  and I thought    well you know how we all are. You want to get the feeling of the room  and  do people like me   and  will I really say something intelligent   And all of a sudden I thought   Well  wait a minute. I am sitting behind a sign that says 'The United States ' and if I don't speak today then the voice of the United States will not be heard   and it was the first time that I had that feeling that I had to step out of myself in my normal  reluctant female mode and decide that I had to speak on behalf of our country. And so that happened more at various times  but I really think that there was a great advantage in many ways to being a woman. I think we are a lot better at personal relationships  and then have the capability obviously of telling it like it is when it's necessary. But I have to tell you  I have my youngest granddaughter  when she turned seven last year  said to her mother  my daughter   So what's the big deal about Grandma Maddie being Secretary of State  Only girls are Secretary of State.  PM  Because in her lifetime    MA  That would be so. PM  What a change that is. As you travel now all over the world  which you do frequently  how do you assess this global narrative around the story of women and girls  Where are we  MA  I think we're slowly changing  but obviously there are whole pockets in countries where nothing is different. And therefore it means that we have to remember that  while many of us have had huge opportunities    and Pat  you have been a real leader in your field    is that there are a lot of women that are not capable of worrying and taking care of themselves and understanding that women have to help other women. And so what I have felt    and I have looked at this from a national security issue    when I was Secretary of State  I decided that women's issues had to be central to American foreign policy  not just because I'm a feminist  but because I believe that societies are better off when women are politically and economically empowered  that values are passed down  the health situation is better  education is better  there is greater economic prosperity. So I think that it behooves us    those of us that live in various countries where we do have economic and political voice    that we need to help other women. And I really dedicated myself to that  both at the U.N. and then as Secretary of State. PM  And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy  MA  From some people. I think that they thought that it was a soft issue. The bottom line that I decided was actually women's issues are the hardest issues  because they are the ones that have to do with life and death in so many aspects  and because  as I said  it is really central to the way that we think about things. Now for instance  some of the wars that took place when I was in office  a lot of them  the women were the main victims of it. For instance  when I started  there were wars in the Balkans. The women in Bosnia were being raped. We then managed to set up a war crimes tribunal to deal specifically with those kinds of issues. And by the way  one of the things that I did at that stage was  I had just arrived at the U.N.  and when I was there  there were     countries in the U.N. Now there are    . But it was one of the first times that I didn't have to cook lunch myself. So I said to my assistant   Invite the other women permanent representatives.  And I thought when I'd get to my apartment that there'd be a lot of women there. I get there  and there are six other women  out of    . So the countries that had women representatives were Canada  Kazakhstan  Philippines  Trinidad Tobago  Jamaica  Lichtenstein and me. So being an American  I decided to set up a caucus. And so we set it up  and we called ourselves the G . PM  Is that  Girl     MA  Girl  . And we lobbied on behalf of women's issues. So we managed to get two women judges on this war crimes tribunal. And then what happened was that they were able to declare that rape was a weapon of war  that it was against humanity. PM  So when you look around the world and you see that  in many cases    certainly in the Western world    women are evolving into more leadership positions  and even other places some barriers are being brought down  but there's still so much violence  still so many problems  and yet we hear there are more women at the negotiating tables. Now you were at those negotiating tables when they weren't  when there was maybe you    one voice  maybe one or two others. Do you believe  and can you tell us why  there is going to be a significant shift in things like violence and peace and conflict and resolution on a sustainable basis  MA  Well I do think  when there are more women  that the tone of the conversation changes  and also the goals of the conversation change. But it doesn't mean that the whole world would be a lot better if it were totally run by women. If you think that  you've forgotten high school. But the bottom line is that there is a way  when there are more women at the table  that there's an attempt to develop some understanding. So for instance  what I did when I went to Burundi  we'd got Tutsi and Hutu women together to talk about some of the problems that had taken place in Rwanda. And so I think the capability of women to put themselves    I think we're better about putting ourselves into the other guy's shoes and having more empathy. I think it helps in terms of the support if there are other women in the room. When I was Secretary of State  there were only    other women foreign ministers. And so it was nice when one of them would show up. For instance  she is now the president of Finland  but Tarja Halonen was the foreign minister of Finland and  at a certain stage  head of the European Union. And it was really terrific. Because one of the things I think you'll understand. We went to a meeting  and the men in my delegation  when I would say   Well I feel we should do something about this   and they'd say   What do you mean  you feel   And so then Tarja was sitting across the table from me. And all of a sudden we were talking about arms control  and she said   Well I feel we should do this.  And my male colleagues kind of got it all of a sudden. But I think it really does help to have a critical mass of women in a series of foreign policy positions. The other thing that I think is really important  A lot of national security policy isn't just about foreign policy  but it's about budgets  military budgets  and how the debts of countries work out. So if you have women in a variety of foreign policy posts  they can support each other when there are budget decisions being made in their own countries. PM  So how do we get this balance we're looking for  then  in the world  More women's voices at the table  More men who believe that the balance is best  MA  Well I think one of the things    I'm chairman of the board of an organization called the National Democratic Institute that works to support women candidates. I think that we need to help in other countries to train women to be in political office  to figure out how they can in fact develop political voices. I think we also need to be supportive when businesses are being created and just make sure that women help each other. Now I have a saying that I feel very strongly about  because I am of a certain age where  when I started in my career  believe it or not  there were other women who criticized me   Why aren't you in the carpool line   or  Aren't your children suffering because you're not there all the time   And I think we have a tendency to make each other feel guilty. In fact  I think  guilt  is every woman's middle name. And so I think what needs to happen is we need to help each other. And my motto is that there's a special place in hell for women who don't help each other. PM  Well Secretary Albright  I guess you'll be going to heaven. Thank you for joining us today. MA  Thank you all. Thanks Pat. It's Monday morning. In Washington  the president of the United States is sitting in the Oval Office  assessing whether or not to strike Al Qaeda in Yemen. At Number    Downing Street  David Cameron is trying to work out whether to cut more public sector jobs in order to stave off a double dip recession. In Madrid  Maria Gonzalez is standing at the door  listening to her baby crying and crying  trying to work out whether she should let it cry until it falls asleep or pick it up and hold it. And I am sitting by my father's bedside in hospital  trying to work out whether I should let him drink the one and a half liter bottle of water that his doctors just came in and said   You must make him drink today      my father's been nil by mouth for a week    or whether  by giving him this bottle  I might actually kill him. We face momentous decisions with important consequences throughout our lives  and we have strategies for dealing with these decisions. We talk things over with our friends  we scour the Internet  we search through books. But still  even in this age of Google and TripAdvisor and Amazon Recommends  it's still experts that we rely upon most    especially when the stakes are high and the decision really matters. Because in a world of data deluge and extreme complexity  we believe that experts are more able to process information than we can    that they are able to come to better conclusions than we could come to on our own. And in an age that is sometimes nowadays frightening or confusing  we feel reassured by the almost parental like authority of experts who tell us so clearly what it is we can and cannot do. But I believe that this is a big problem  a problem with potentially dangerous consequences for us as a society  as a culture and as individuals. It's not that experts have not massively contributed to the world    of course they have. The problem lies with us  we've become addicted to experts. We've become addicted to their certainty  their assuredness  their definitiveness  and in the process  we have ceded our responsibility  substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom. We've surrendered our power  trading off our discomfort with uncertainty for the illusion of certainty that they provide. This is no exaggeration. In a recent experiment  a group of adults had their brains scanned in an MRI machine as they were listening to experts speak. The results were quite extraordinary. As they listened to the experts' voices  the independent decision making parts of their brains switched off. It literally flat lined. And they listened to whatever the experts said and took their advice  however right or wrong. But experts do get things wrong. Did you know that studies show that doctors misdiagnose four times out of     Did you know that if you file your tax returns yourself  you're statistically more likely to be filing them correctly than if you get a tax adviser to do it for you  And then there's  of course  the example that we're all too aware of  financial experts getting it so wrong that we're living through the worst recession since the     s. For the sake of our health  our wealth and our collective security  it's imperative that we keep the independent decision making parts of our brains switched on. And I'm saying this as an economist who  over the past few years  has focused my research on what it is we think and who it is we trust and why  but also    and I'm aware of the irony here    as an expert myself  as a professor  as somebody who advises prime ministers  heads of big companies  international organizations  but an expert who believes that the role of experts needs to change  that we need to become more open minded  more democratic and be more open to people rebelling against our points of view. So in order to help you understand where I'm coming from  let me bring you into my world  the world of experts. Now there are  of course  exceptions  wonderful  civilization enhancing exceptions. But what my research has shown me is that experts tend on the whole to form very rigid camps  that within these camps  a dominant perspective emerges that often silences opposition  that experts move with the prevailing winds  often hero worshipping their own gurus. Alan Greenspan's proclamations that the years of economic growth would go on and on  not challenged by his peers  until after the crisis  of course. You see  we also learn that experts are located  are governed  by the social and cultural norms of their times    whether it be the doctors in Victorian England  say  who sent women to asylums for expressing sexual desire  or the psychiatrists in the United States who  up until       were still categorizing homosexuality as a mental illness. And what all this means is that paradigms take far too long to shift  that complexity and nuance are ignored and also that money talks    because we've all seen the evidence of pharmaceutical companies funding studies of drugs that conveniently leave out their worst side effects  or studies funded by food companies of their new products  massively exaggerating the health benefits of the products they're about to bring by market. The study showed that food companies exaggerated typically seven times more than an independent study. And we've also got to be aware that experts  of course  also make mistakes. They make mistakes every single day    mistakes born out of carelessness. A recent study in the Archives of Surgery reported surgeons removing healthy ovaries  operating on the wrong side of the brain  carrying out procedures on the wrong hand  elbow  eye  foot  and also mistakes born out of thinking errors. A common thinking error of radiologists  for example    when they look at CT scans    is that they're overly influenced by whatever it is that the referring physician has said that he suspects the patient's problem to be. So if a radiologist is looking at the scan of a patient with suspected pneumonia  say  what happens is that  if they see evidence of pneumonia on the scan  they literally stop looking at it    thereby missing the tumor sitting three inches below on the patient's lungs. I've shared with you so far some insights into the world of experts. These are  of course  not the only insights I could share  but I hope they give you a clear sense at least of why we need to stop kowtowing to them  why we need to rebel and why we need to switch our independent decision making capabilities on. But how can we do this  Well for the sake of time  I want to focus on just three strategies. First  we've got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern day apostles. This doesn't mean having to get a Ph.D. in every single subject  you'll be relieved to hear. But it does mean persisting in the face of their inevitable annoyance when  for example  we want them to explain things to us in language that we can actually understand. Why was it that  when I had an operation  my doctor said to me   Beware  Ms. Hertz  of hyperpyrexia   when he could have just as easily said   Watch out for a high fever.  You see  being ready to take experts on is about also being willing to dig behind their graphs  their equations  their forecasts  their prophecies  and being armed with the questions to do that    questions like  What are the assumptions that underpin this  What is the evidence upon which this is based  What has your investigation focused on  And what has it ignored  It recently came out that experts trialing drugs before they come to market typically trial drugs first  primarily on male animals and then  primarily on men. It seems that they've somehow overlooked the fact that over half the world's population are women. And women have drawn the short medical straw because it now turns out that many of these drugs don't work nearly as well on women as they do on men    and the drugs that do work well work so well that they're actively harmful for women to take. Being a rebel is about recognizing that experts' assumptions and their methodologies can easily be flawed. Second  we need to create the space for what I call  managed dissent.  If we are to shift paradigms  if we are to make breakthroughs  if we are to destroy myths  we need to create an environment in which expert ideas are battling it out  in which we're bringing in new  diverse  discordant  heretical views into the discussion  fearlessly  in the knowledge that progress comes about  not only from the creation of ideas  but also from their destruction    and also from the knowledge that  by surrounding ourselves by divergent  discordant  heretical views. All the research now shows us that this actually makes us smarter. Encouraging dissent is a rebellious notion because it goes against our very instincts  which are to surround ourselves with opinions and advice that we already believe or want to be true. And that's why I talk about the need to actively manage dissent. Google CEO Eric Schmidt is a practical practitioner of this philosophy. In meetings  he looks out for the person in the room    arms crossed  looking a bit bemused    and draws them into the discussion  trying to see if they indeed are the person with a different opinion  so that they have dissent within the room. Managing dissent is about recognizing the value of disagreement  discord and difference. But we need to go even further. We need to fundamentally redefine who it is that experts are. The conventional notion is that experts are people with advanced degrees  fancy titles  diplomas  best selling books    high status individuals. But just imagine if we were to junk this notion of expertise as some sort of elite cadre and instead embrace the notion of democratized expertise    whereby expertise was not just the preserve of surgeons and CEO's  but also shop girls    yeah. Best Buy  the consumer electronics company  gets all its employees    the cleaners  the shop assistants  the people in the back office  not just its forecasting team    to place bets  yes bets  on things like whether or not a product is going to sell well before Christmas  on whether customers' new ideas are going to be or should be taken on by the company  on whether a project will come in on time. By leveraging and by embracing the expertise within the company  Best Buy was able to discover  for example  that the store that it was going to open in China    its big  grand store    was not going to open on time. Because when it asked its staff  all its staff  to place their bets on whether they thought the store would open on time or not  a group from the finance department placed all their chips on that not happening. It turned out that they were aware  as no one else within the company was  of a technological blip that neither the forecasting experts  nor the experts on the ground in China  were even aware of. The strategies that I have discussed this evening    embracing dissent  taking experts on  democratizing expertise  rebellious strategies    are strategies that I think would serve us all well to embrace as we try to deal with the challenges of these very confusing  complex  difficult times. For if we keep our independent decision making part of our brains switched on  if we challenge experts  if we're skeptical  if we devolve authority  if we are rebellious  but also if we become much more comfortable with nuance  uncertainty and doubt  and if we allow our experts to express themselves using those terms too  we will set ourselves up much better for the challenges of the   st century. For now  more than ever  is not the time to be blindly following  blindly accepting  blindly trusting. Now is the time to face the world with eyes wide open    yes  using experts to help us figure things out  for sure    I don't want to completely do myself out of a job here    but being aware of their limitations and  of course  also our own. Thank you. Our face is hugely important because it's the external  visual part that everybody else sees. Let's not forget it's a functional entity. We have strong skull bones that protect the most important organ in our body  the brain. It's where our senses are located  our special senses    our vision  our speech  our hearing  our smell  our taste. And this bone is peppered  as you can see  with the light shining through the skull with cavities  the sinuses  which warm and moisten the air we breathe. But also imagine if they were filled with solid bone    our head would be dead weight  we wouldn't be able to hold it erect  we wouldn't be able to look at the world around us. This woman is slowly dying because the benign tumors in her facial bones have completely obliterated her mouth and her nose so she can't breathe and eat. Attached to the facial bones that define our face's structure are the muscles that deliver our facial expression  our universal language of expression  our social signaling system. And overlying this is the skin drape  which is a hugely complex three dimensional structure    taking right angled bends here and there  having thin areas like the eyelids  thick areas like the cheek  different colors. And then we have the sensual factor of the face. Where do we like to kiss people  On the lips. Nibble the ears maybe. It's the face where we're attracted to with that. But let's not forget the hair. You're looking at the image on your left hand side    that's my son with his eyebrows present. Look how odd he looks with the eyebrows missing. There's a definite difference. And imagine if he had hair sprouting from the middle of his nose  he'd look even odder still. Dysmorphophobia is an extreme version of the fact that we don't see ourselves as others see us. It's a shocking truth that we only see mirror images of ourselves  and we only see ourselves in freeze frame photographic images that capture a mere fraction of the time that we live. Dysmorphophobia is a perversion of this where people who may be very good looking regard themselves as hideously ugly and are constantly seeking surgery to correct their facial appearance. They don't need this. They need psychiatric help. Max has kindly donated his photograph to me. He doesn't have dysmorphophobia  but I'm using his photograph to illustrate the fact that he looks exactly like a dysmorphophobic. In other words  he looks entirely normal. Age is another thing when our attitude toward our appearance changes. So children judge themselves  learn to judge themselves  by the behavior of adults around them. Here's a classic example  Rebecca has a benign blood vessel tumor that's growing out through her skull  has obliterated her nose  and she's having difficulty seeing. As you can see  it's blocking her vision. She's also in danger  when she damages this  of bleeding profusely. Our research has shown that the parents and close loved ones of these children adore them. They've grown used to their face  they think they're special. Actually  sometimes the parents argue about whether these children should have the lesion removed. And occasionally they suffer intense grief reactions because the child they've grown to love has changed so dramatically and they don't recognize them. But other adults say incredibly painful things. They say   How dare you take this child out of the house and terrify other people. Shouldn't you be doing something about this  Why haven't you had it removed   And other children in curiosity come up and poke the lesion  because    a natural curiosity. And that obviously alerts the child to their unusual nature. After surgery  everything normalizes. The adults behave more naturally  and the children play more readily with other children. As teenagers    just think back to your teenage years    we're going through a dramatic and often disproportionate change in our facial appearance. We're trying to struggle to find our identity. We crave the approval of our peers. So our facial appearance is vital to us as we're trying to project ourselves to the world. Just remember that single acne spot that crippled you for several days. How long did you spend looking in the mirror every day  practicing your sardonic look  practicing your serious look  trying to look like Sean Connery  as I did  trying to raise one eyebrow  It's a crippling time. I've chosen to show this profile view of Sue because what it shows is her lower jaw jutting forward and her lower lip jutting forward. I'd like you all in the audience now to push your lower jaw forward. Turn to the person next to you  push your lower jaws forward. Turn to the person next to you and look at them    they look miserable. That's exactly what people used to say to Sue. She wasn't miserable at all. But people used to say to her   Why are you so miserable   People were making misjudgments all the time on her mood. Teachers and peers were underestimating her  she was teased at school. So she chose to have facial surgery. After the facial surgery  she said   My face now reflects my personality. People know now that I'm enthusiastic  that I'm a happy person.  And that's the change that can be achieved for teenagers. Is this change  though  a real change  or is it a figment of the imagination of the patient themselves  Well we studied teenagers' attitudes to photographs of patients having this corrective facial surgery. And what we found was    we jumbled up the photographs so they couldn't recognize the before and after    what we found was that the patients were regarded as being more attractive after the surgery. Well that's not surprising  but we also asked them to judge them on honesty  intelligence  friendliness  violence. They were all perceived as being less than normal in all those characteristics    more violent  etc.    before the surgery. After the surgery  they were perceived as being more intelligent  more friendly  more honest  less violent    and yet we hadn't operated on their intellect or their character. When people get older  they don't necessarily choose to follow this kind of surgery. Their presence in the consultation suite is a result of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. What happens to them is that they may have suffered cancer or trauma. So this is a photograph of Henry  two weeks after he had a malignant cancer removed from the left side of his face    his cheekbone  his upper jaw  his eye socket. He looks pretty good at this stage. But over the course of the next    years he had    more operations  as the disease ravaged his face and destroyed my reconstruction regularly. I learned a huge amount from Henry. Henry taught me that you can carry on working. He worked as an advocate. He continued to play cricket. He enjoyed life to the full  and this was probably because he had a successful  fulfilling job and a caring family and was able to participate socially. He maintained a calm insouciance. I don't say he overcame this  he didn't overcome it. This was something more than that. He ignored it. He ignored the disfigurement that was happening in his life and carried on oblivious to it. And that's what these people can do. Henriapi illustrates this phenomenon as well. This is a man in his   s whose first visit out of Nigeria was with this malignant cancer that he came to the United Kingdom to have operated on. It was my longest operation. It took    hours. I did it with my neurosurgeon. We removed all the bones at the right side of his face    his eye  his nose  the skull bones  the facial skin    and reconstructed him with tissue from the back. He continued to work as a psychiatric nurse. He got married. He had a son called Jeremiah. And again  he said   This painting of me with my son Jeremiah shows me as the successful man that I feel that I am.  His facial disfigurement did not affect him because he had the support of a family  he had a successful  fulfilling job. So we've seen that we can change people's faces. But when we change people's faces  are we changing their identity    for better or for worse  For instance  there are two different types of facial surgery. We can categorize it like that. We can say there are patients who choose to have facial surgery    like Sue. When they have facial surgery  they feel their lives have changed because other people perceive them as better people. They don't feel different. They feel that they've actually gained what they never had  that their face now reflects their personality. And actually that's probably the difference between cosmetic surgery and this kind of surgery. Because you might say   Well  this type of surgery might be regarded as cosmetic.  If you do cosmetic surgery  patients are often less happy. They're trying to achieve difference in their lives. Sue wasn't trying to achieve difference in her life. She was just trying to achieve the face that matched her personality. But then we have other people who don't choose to have facial surgery. They're people who have their face shot off. I'll move it off  and we'll have a blank slide for those who are squeamish amongst you. They have it forced upon them. And again  as I told you  if they have a caring family and good work life  then they can lead normal and fulfilled lives. Their identity doesn't change. Is this business about appearance and preoccupation with it a Western phenomenon  Muzetta's family give the lie to this. This is a little Bangladeshi girl from the east end of London who's got a huge malignant tumor on the right side of her face  which has already made her blind and which is rapidly growing and is going to kill her shortly. After she had surgery to remove the tumor  her parents dressed her in this beautiful green velvet dress  a pink ribbon in her hair  and they wanted the painting to be shown around the world  despite the fact that they were orthodox Muslims and the mother wore a full burqa. So it's not simply a Western phenomenon. We make judgments on people's faces all the time. It's been going on since we can think of Lombroso and the way he would define criminal faces. He said you could see criminal faces  judging them just on the photographs that were showed. Good looking people are always judged as being more friendly. We look at O.J.    he's a good looking guy. We'd like to spend time with him. He looks friendly. Now we know that he's a convicted wife batterer  and actually he's not the good guy. And beauty doesn't equate to goodness  and certainly doesn't equate to contentment. So we've talked about the static face and judging the static face  but actually  we're more comfortable with judging the moving face. We think we can judge people on their expressions. U.K. jurors in the U.K. justice system like to see a live witness to see whether they can pick up the telltale signs of mendacity    the blink  the hesitation. And so they want to see live witnesses. Todorov tells us that  in a tenth of a second  we can make a judgment on somebody's face. Are we uncomfortable with this image  Yes  we are. Would we be happy if our doctor's face  our lawyer's face  our financial adviser's face was covered  We'd be pretty uncomfortable. But are we good at making the judgments on facial appearance and movement  The truth is that there's a five minute rule  not the tenth of a second rule like Todorov  but a five minute rule. If you spend five minutes with somebody  you start looking beyond their facial appearance  and the people who you're initially attracted to may seem boring and you lose interest in them  and the people who you didn't immediately seek out  because you didn't find them particularly attractive  become attractive people because of their personality. So we've talked a lot about facial appearance. I now want to share a little bit of the surgery that we do    where we're at and where we're going. This is an image of Ann who's had her right jaw removed and the base of her skull removed. And you can see in the images afterward  we've managed to reconstruct her successfully. But that's not good enough. This is what Ann wants. She wants to be out kayaking  she wants to be out climbing mountains. And that's what she achieved  and that's what we have to get to. This is a horrific image  so I'm putting my hand up now. This is a photograph of Adi  a Nigerian bank manager who had his face shot off in an armed robbery. And he lost his lower jaw  his lip  his chin and his upper jaw and teeth. This is the bar that he set for us.  I want to look like this. This is how I looked before.  So with modern technology  we used computers to make models. We made a model of the jaw without bone in it. We then bent a plate up to it. We put it in place so we knew it was an accurate position. We then put bone and tissue from the back. Here you can see the plate holding it  and you can see the implants being put in    so that in one operation we achieve this and this. So the patient's life is restored. That's the good news. However  his chin skin doesn't look the same as it did before. It's skin from his back. It's thicker  it's darker  it's coarser  it doesn't have the contours. And that's where we're failing  and that's where we need the face transplant. The face transplant has a role probably in burns patients to replace the skin. We can replace the underlying skeletal structure  but we're still not good at replacing the facial skin. So it's very valuable to have that tool in our armamentarium. But the patients are going to have to take drugs that suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. What does that mean  They have an increased risk of infection  an increased risk of malignancy. This is not a life saving transplant    like a heart  or liver  or lung transplant    it is a quality of life transplant  and as a result  are the patients going to say  if they get a malignant cancer    or    years on   I wish I'd had conventional reconstructive techniques rather than this because I'm now dying of a malignant cancer   We don't know yet. We also don't know what they feel about recognition and identity. Bernard Devauchelle and Sylvie Testelin  who did the first operation  are studying that. Donors are going to be short on the ground  because how many people want to have their loved one's face removed at the point of death  So there are going to be problems with face transplantation. So the better news is the future's almost here    and the future is tissue engineering. Just imagine  I can make a biologically degradable template. I can put it in place where it's meant to be. I can sprinkle a few cells  stem cells from the patient's own hip  a little bit of genetically engineered protein  and lo and behold  leave it for four months and the face is grown. This is a bit like a Julia Child recipe. But we've still got problems. We've got mouth cancer to solve. We're still not curing enough patients    it's the most disfiguring cancer. We're still not reconstructing them well enough. In the U.K. we have an epidemic of facial injuries among young people. We still can't get rid of scars. We need to do research. And the best news of all is that surgeons know that we need to do research. And we've set up charities that will help us fund the clinical research to determine the best treatment practice now and better treatment into the future  so we don't just sit on our laurels and say   Okay  we're doing okay. Let's leave it as it is.  Thank you very much indeed. As a child  I was raised by native Hawaiian elders    three old women who took care of me while my parents worked. The year is     . We're at the ocean. It's twilight. We're watching the rising of the stars and the shifting of the tides. It's a stretch of beach we know so well. The smooth stones on the sand are familiar to us. If you saw these women on the street in their faded clothes  you might dismiss them as poor and simple. That would be a mistake. These women are descendants of Polynesian navigators  trained in the old ways by their elders  and now they're passing it on to me. They teach me the names of the winds and the rains  of astronomy according to a genealogy of stars. There's a new moon on the horizon. Hawaiians say it's a good night for fishing. They begin to chant.  Hawaiian chant  When they finish  they sit in a circle and ask me to come to join them. They want to teach me about my destiny. I thought every seven year old went through this.  Baby girl  someday the world will be in trouble. People will forget their wisdom. It will take elders' voices from the far corners of the world to call the world into balance. You will go far away. It will sometimes be a lonely road. We will not be there. But you will look into the eyes of seeming strangers  and you will recognize your ohana  your family. And it will take all of you. It will take all of you.  These words  I hold onto all my life. Because the idea of doing it alone terrifies me. The year is     . I'm on a remote island in Micronesia. Satawal is one half mile long by one mile wide. It's the home of my mentor. His name is Pius Mau Piailug. Mau is a palu  a navigator priest. He's also considered the greatest wave finder in the world. There are fewer than a handful of palu left on this island. Their tradition is so extraordinary that these mariners sailed three million square miles across the Pacific without the use of instruments. They could synthesize patterns in nature using the rising and setting of stars  the sequence and direction of waves  the flight patterns of certain birds. Even the slightest hint of color on the underbelly of a cloud would inform them and help them navigate with the keenest accuracy. When Western scientists would join Mau on the canoe and watch him go into the hull  it appeared that an old man was going to rest. In fact  the hull of the canoe is the womb of the vessel. It is the most accurate place to feel the rhythm and sequence and direction of waves. Mau was  in fact  gathering explicit data using his entire body. It's what he had been trained to do since he was five years old. Now science may dismiss this methodology  but Polynesian navigators use it today because it provides them an accurate determination of the angle and direction of their vessel. The palu also had an uncanny ability to forecast weather conditions days in advance. Sometimes I'd be with Mau on a cloud covered night and we'd sit at the easternmost coast of the island  and he would look out  and then he would say   Okay  we go.  He saw that first glint of light    he knew what the weather was going to be three days from now. Their achievements  intellectually and scientifically  are extraordinary  and they are so relevant for these times that we are in when we are riding out storms. We are in such a critical moment of our collective history. They have been compared to astronauts    these elder navigators who sail vast open oceans in double hulled canoes thousands of miles from a small island. Their canoes  our rockets  their sea  our space. The wisdom of these elders is not a mere collection of stories about old people in some remote spot. This is part of our collective narrative. It's humanity's DNA. We cannot afford to lose it. The year is     . Just as the women in Hawaii that raised me predicted  the world is in trouble. We live in a society bloated with data  yet starved for wisdom. We're connected       yet anxiety  fear  depression and loneliness is at an all time high. We must course correct. An African shaman said   Your society worships the jester while the king stands in plain clothes.  The link between the past and the future is fragile. This I know intimately  because even as I travel throughout the world to listen to these stories and record them  I struggle. I am haunted by the fact that I no longer remember the names of the winds and the rains. Mau passed away five months ago  but his legacy and lessons live on. And I am reminded that throughout the world there are cultures with vast sums of knowledge in them  as potent as the Micronesian navigators  that are going dismissed  that this is a testament to brilliant  brilliant technology and science and wisdom that is vanishing rapidly. Because when an elder dies a library is burned  and throughout the world  libraries are ablaze. I am grateful for the fact that I had a mentor like Mau who taught me how to navigate. And I realize through a lesson that he shared that we continue to find our way. And this is what he said   The island is the canoe  the canoe  the island.  And what he meant was  if you are voyaging and far from home  your very survival depends on everyone aboard. You cannot make the voyage alone  you were never meant to. This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable. It always was. So in closing I would offer you this  The planet is our canoe  and we are the voyagers. True navigation begins in the human heart. It's the most important map of all. Together  may we journey well. I admit that I'm a little bit nervous here because I'm going to say some radical things  about how we should think about cancer differently  to an audience that contains a lot of people who know a lot more about cancer than I do. But I will also contest that I'm not as nervous as I should be because I'm pretty sure I'm right about this. And that this  in fact  will be the way that we treat cancer in the future. In order to talk about cancer  I'm going to actually have to    let me get the big slide here. First  I'm going to try to give you a different perspective of genomics. I want to put it in perspective of the bigger picture of all the other things that are going on    and then talk about something you haven't heard so much about  which is proteomics. Having explained those  that will set up for what I think will be a different idea about how to go about treating cancer. So let me start with genomics. It is the hot topic. It is the place where we're learning the most. This is the great frontier. But it has its limitations. And in particular  you've probably all heard the analogy that the genome is like the blueprint of your body  and if that were only true  it would be great  but it's not. It's like the parts list of your body. It doesn't say how things are connected  what causes what and so on. So if I can make an analogy  let's say that you were trying to tell the difference between a good restaurant  a healthy restaurant and a sick restaurant  and all you had was the list of ingredients that they had in their larder. So it might be that  if you went to a French restaurant and you looked through it and you found they only had margarine and they didn't have butter  you could say   Ah  I see what's wrong with them. I can make them healthy.  And there probably are special cases of that. You could certainly tell the difference between a Chinese restaurant and a French restaurant by what they had in a larder. So the list of ingredients does tell you something  and sometimes it tells you something that's wrong. If they have tons of salt  you might guess they're using too much salt  or something like that. But it's limited  because really to know if it's a healthy restaurant  you need to taste the food  you need to know what goes on in the kitchen  you need the product of all of those ingredients. So if I look at a person and I look at a person's genome  it's the same thing. The part of the genome that we can read is the list of ingredients. And so indeed  there are times when we can find ingredients that  are  bad. Cystic fibrosis is an example of a disease where you just have a bad ingredient and you have a disease  and we can actually make a direct correspondence between the ingredient and the disease. But most things  you really have to know what's going on in the kitchen  because  mostly  sick people used to be healthy people    they have the same genome. So the genome really tells you much more about predisposition. So what you can tell is you can tell the difference between an Asian person and a European person by looking at their ingredients list. But you really for the most part can't tell the difference between a healthy person and a sick person    except in some of these special cases. So why all the big deal about genetics  Well first of all  it's because we can read it  which is fantastic. It is very useful in certain circumstances. It's also the great theoretical triumph of biology. It's the one theory that the biologists ever really got right. It's fundamental to Darwin and Mendel and so on. And so it's the one thing where they predicted a theoretical construct. So Mendel had this idea of a gene as an abstract thing  and Darwin built a whole theory that depended on them existing  and then Watson and Crick actually looked and found one. So this happens in physics all the time. You predict a black hole  and you look out the telescope and there it is  just like you said. But it rarely happens in biology. So this great triumph    it's so good  there's almost a religious experience in biology. And Darwinian evolution is really the core theory. So the other reason it's been very popular is because we can measure it  it's digital. And in fact  thanks to Kary Mullis  you can basically measure your genome in your kitchen with a few extra ingredients. So for instance  by measuring the genome  we've learned a lot about how we're related to other kinds of animals by the closeness of our genome  or how we're related to each other    the family tree  or the tree of life. There's a huge amount of information about the genetics just by comparing the genetic similarity. Now of course  in medical application  that is very useful because it's the same kind of information that the doctor gets from your family medical history    except probably  your genome knows much more about your medical history than you do. And so by reading the genome  we can find out much more about your family than you probably know. And so we can discover things that probably you could have found by looking at enough of your relatives  but they may be surprising. I did the   andMe thing and was very surprised to discover that I am fat and bald. But sometimes you can learn much more useful things about that. But mostly what you need to know  to find out if you're sick  is not your predispositions  but it's actually what's going on in your body right now. So to do that  what you really need to do  you need to look at the things that the genes are producing and what's happening after the genetics  and that's what proteomics is about. Just like genome mixes the study of all the genes  proteomics is the study of all the proteins. And the proteins are all of the little things in your body that are signaling between the cells    actually  the machines that are operating    that's where the action is. Basically  a human body is a conversation going on  both within the cells and between the cells  and they're telling each other to grow and to die  and when you're sick  something's gone wrong with that conversation. And so the trick is    unfortunately  we don't have an easy way to measure these like we can measure the genome. So the problem is that measuring    if you try to measure all the proteins  it's a very elaborate process. It requires hundreds of steps  and it takes a long  long time. And it matters how much of the protein it is. It could be very significant that a protein changed by    percent  so it's not a nice digital thing like DNA. And basically our problem is somebody's in the middle of this very long stage  they pause for just a moment  and they leave something in an enzyme for a second  and all of a sudden all the measurements from then on don't work. And so then people get very inconsistent results when they do it this way. People have tried very hard to do this. I tried this a couple of times and looked at this problem and gave up on it. I kept getting this call from this oncologist named David Agus. And Applied Minds gets a lot of calls from people who want help with their problems  and I didn't think this was a very likely one to call back  so I kept on giving him to the delay list. And then one day  I get a call from John Doerr  Bill Berkman and Al Gore on the same day saying return David Agus's phone call. So I was like   Okay. This guy's at least resourceful.  So we started talking  and he said   I really need a better way to measure proteins.  I'm like   Looked at that. Been there. Not going to be easy.  He's like   No  no. I really need it. I mean  I see patients dying every day because we don't know what's going on inside of them. We have to have a window into this.  And he took me through specific examples of when he really needed it. And I realized  wow  this would really make a big difference  if we could do it  and so I said   Well  let's look at it.  Applied Minds has enough play money that we can go and just work on something without getting anybody's funding or permission or anything. So we started playing around with this. And as we did it  we realized this was the basic problem    that taking the sip of coffee    that there were humans doing this complicated process and that what really needed to be done was to automate this process like an assembly line and build robots that would measure proteomics. And so we did that  and working with David  we made a little company called Applied Proteomics eventually  which makes this robotic assembly line  which  in a very consistent way  measures the protein. And I'll show you what that protein measurement looks like. Basically  what we do is we take a drop of blood out of a patient  and we sort out the proteins in the drop of blood according to how much they weigh  how slippery they are  and we arrange them in an image. And so we can look at literally hundreds of thousands of features at once out of that drop of blood. And we can take a different one tomorrow  and you will see your proteins tomorrow will be different    they'll be different after you eat or after you sleep. They really tell us what's going on there. And so this picture  which looks like a big smudge to you  is actually the thing that got me really thrilled about this and made me feel like we were on the right track. So if I zoom into that picture  I can just show you what it means. We sort out the proteins    from left to right is the weight of the fragments that we're getting  and from top to bottom is how slippery they are. So we're zooming in here just to show you a little bit of it. And so each of these lines represents some signal that we're getting out of a piece of a protein. And you can see how the lines occur in these little groups of bump  bump  bump  bump  bump. And that's because we're measuring the weight so precisely that    carbon comes in different isotopes  so if it has an extra neutron on it  we actually measure it as a different chemical. So we're actually measuring each isotope as a different one. And so that gives you an idea of how exquisitely sensitive this is. So seeing this picture is sort of like getting to be Galileo and looking at the stars and looking through the telescope for the first time  and suddenly you say   Wow  it's way more complicated than we thought it was.  But we can see that stuff out there and actually see features of it. So this is the signature out of which we're trying to get patterns. So what we do with this is  for example  we can look at two patients  one that responded to a drug and one that didn't respond to a drug  and ask   What's going on differently inside of them   And so we can make these measurements precisely enough that we can overlay two patients and look at the differences. So here we have Alice in green and Bob in red. We overlay them. This is actual data. And you can see  mostly it overlaps and it's yellow  but there's some things that just Alice has and some things that just Bob has. And if we find a pattern of things of the responders to the drug  we see that in the blood  they have the condition that allows them to respond to this drug. We might not even know what this protein is  but we can see it's a marker for the response to the disease. So this already  I think  is tremendously useful in all kinds of medicine. But I think this is actually just the beginning of how we're going to treat cancer. So let me move to cancer. The thing about cancer    when I got into this  I really knew nothing about it  but working with David Agus  I started watching how cancer was actually being treated and went to operations where it was being cut out. And as I looked at it  to me it didn't make sense how we were approaching cancer  and in order to make sense of it  I had to learn where did this come from. We're treating cancer almost like it's an infectious disease. We're treating it as something that got inside of you that we have to kill. So this is the great paradigm. This is another case where a theoretical paradigm in biology really worked    was the germ theory of disease. So what doctors are mostly trained to do is diagnose    that is  put you into a category and apply a scientifically proven treatment for that diagnosis    and that works great for infectious diseases. So if we put you in the category of you've got syphilis  we can give you penicillin. We know that that works. If you've got malaria  we give you quinine or some derivative of it. And so that's the basic thing doctors are trained to do  and it's miraculous in the case of infectious disease    how well it works. And many people in this audience probably wouldn't be alive if doctors didn't do this. But now let's apply that to systems diseases like cancer. The problem is that  in cancer  there isn't something else that's inside of you. It's you  you're broken. That conversation inside of you got mixed up in some way. So how do we diagnose that conversation  Well  right now what we do is we divide it by part of the body    you know  where did it appear     and we put you in different categories according to the part of the body. And then we do a clinical trial for a drug for lung cancer and one for prostate cancer and one for breast cancer  and we treat these as if they're separate diseases and that this way of dividing them had something to do with what actually went wrong. And of course  it really doesn't have that much to do with what went wrong because cancer is a failure of the system. And in fact  I think we're even wrong when we talk about cancer as a thing. I think this is the big mistake. I think cancer should not be a noun. We should talk about cancering as something we do  not something we have. And so those tumors  those are symptoms of cancer. And so your body is probably cancering all the time  but there are lots of systems in your body that keep it under control. And so to give you an idea of an analogy of what I mean by thinking of cancering as a verb  imagine we didn't know anything about plumbing  and the way that we talked about it  we'd come home and we'd find a leak in our kitchen and we'd say   Oh  my house has water.  We might divide it    the plumber would say   Well  where's the water    Well  it's in the kitchen.   Oh  you must have kitchen water.  That's kind of the level at which it is.  Kitchen water  well  first of all  we'll go in there and we'll mop out a lot of it. And then we know that if we sprinkle Drano around the kitchen  that helps. Whereas living room water  it's better to do tar on the roof.  And it sounds silly  but that's basically what we do. And I'm not saying you shouldn't mop up your water if you have cancer  but I'm saying that's not really the problem  that's the symptom of the problem. What we really need to get at is the process that's going on  and that's happening at the level of the proteonomic actions  happening at the level of why is your body not healing itself in the way that it normally does  Because normally  your body is dealing with this problem all the time. So your house is dealing with leaks all the time  but it's fixing them. It's draining them out and so on. So what we need is to have a causative model of what's actually going on  and proteomics actually gives us the ability to build a model like that. David got me invited to give a talk at National Cancer Institute and Anna Barker was there. And so I gave this talk and said   Why don't you guys do this   And Anna said   Because nobody within cancer would look at it this way. But what we're going to do  is we're going to create a program for people outside the field of cancer to get together with doctors who really know about cancer and work out different programs of research.  So David and I applied to this program and created a consortium at USC where we've got some of the best oncologists in the world and some of the best biologists in the world  from Cold Spring Harbor  Stanford  Austin    I won't even go through and name all the places    to have a research project that will last for five years where we're really going to try to build a model of cancer like this. We're doing it in mice first  and we will kill a lot of mice in the process of doing this  but they will die for a good cause. And we will actually try to get to the point where we have a predictive model where we can understand  when cancer happens  what's actually happening in there and which treatment will treat that cancer. So let me just end with giving you a little picture of what I think cancer treatment will be like in the future. So I think eventually  once we have one of these models for people  which we'll get eventually    I mean  our group won't get all the way there    but eventually we'll have a very good computer model    sort of like a global climate model for weather. It has lots of different information about what's the process going on in this proteomic conversation on many different scales. And so we will simulate in that model for your particular cancer    and this also will be for ALS  or any kind of system neurodegenerative diseases  things like that    we will simulate specifically you  not just a generic person  but what's actually going on inside you. And in that simulation  what we could do is design for you specifically a sequence of treatments  and it might be very gentle treatments  very small amounts of drugs. It might be things like  don't eat that day  or give them a little chemotherapy  maybe a little radiation. Of course  we'll do surgery sometimes and so on. But design a program of treatments specifically for you and help your body guide back to health    guide your body back to health. Because your body will do most of the work of fixing it if we just sort of prop it up in the ways that are wrong. We put it in the equivalent of splints. And so your body basically has lots and lots of mechanisms for fixing cancer  and we just have to prop those up in the right way and get them to do the job. And so I believe that this will be the way that cancer will be treated in the future. It's going to require a lot of work  a lot of research. There will be many teams like our team that work on this. But I think eventually  we will design for everybody a custom treatment for cancer. So thank you very much.
