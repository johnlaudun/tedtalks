So I want to start by offering you a free no tech life hack  and all it requires of you is this  that you change your posture for two minutes. But before I give it away  I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you're doing with your body. So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller  Maybe you're hunching  crossing your legs  maybe wrapping your ankles. Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this. Sometimes we spread out.  Laughter  I see you. So I want you to pay attention to what you're doing right now. We're going to come back to that in a few minutes  and I'm hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit  it could significantly change the way your life unfolds. So  we're really fascinated with body language  and we're particularly interested in other people's body language. You know  we're interested in  like  you know    Laughter    an awkward interaction  or a smile  or a contemptuous glance  or maybe a very awkward wink  or maybe even something like a handshake. Narrator  Here they are arriving at Number   . This lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President of the United States. Here comes the Prime Minister    No.  Laughter   Applause  Amy Cuddy  So a handshake  or the lack of a handshake  can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks. Even the BBC and The New York Times. So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior  or body language    but we call it nonverbals as social scientists    it's language  so we think about communication. When we think about communication  we think about interactions. So what is your body language communicating to me  What's mine communicating to you  And there's a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this. So social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language  or other people's body language  on judgments. And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language. And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote  who we ask out on a date. For example  Nalini Ambady  a researcher at Tufts University  shows that when people watch    second soundless clips of real physician patient interactions  their judgments of the physician's niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued. So it doesn't have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent  but do we like that person and how they interacted  Even more dramatic  Alex Todorov at Princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates' faces in just one second predict    percent of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes  and even  let's go digital  emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead to you claim more value from that negotiation. If you use them poorly  bad idea. Right  So when we think of nonverbals  we think of how we judge others  how they judge us and what the outcomes are. We tend to forget  though  the other audience that's influenced by our nonverbals  and that's ourselves. We are also influenced by our nonverbals  our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology. So what nonverbals am I talking about  I'm a social psychologist. I study prejudice  and I teach at a competitive business school  so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics. I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance. And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance  Well  this is what they are. So in the animal kingdom  they are about expanding. So you make yourself big  you stretch out  you take up space  you're basically opening up. It's about opening up. And this is true across the animal kingdom. It's not just limited to primates. And humans do the same thing.  Laughter  So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically  and also when they're feeling powerful in the moment. And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are. This expression  which is known as pride  Jessica Tracy has studied. She shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition. So when they cross the finish line and they've won  it doesn't matter if they've never seen anyone do it. They do this. So the arms up in the V  the chin is slightly lifted. What do we do when we feel powerless  We do exactly the opposite. We close up. We wrap ourselves up. We make ourselves small. We don't want to bump into the person next to us. So again  both animals and humans do the same thing. And this is what happens when you put together high and low power. So what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other's nonverbals. So if someone is being really powerful with us  we tend to make ourselves smaller. We don't mirror them. We do the opposite of them. So I'm watching this behavior in the classroom  and what do I notice  I notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals. So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas  really coming into the room  they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts  like they really want to occupy space. When they sit down  they're sort of spread out. They raise their hands like this. You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in. As soon they come in  you see it. You see it on their faces and their bodies  and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny  and they go like this when they raise their hand. I notice a couple of things about this. One  you're not going to be surprised. It seems to be related to gender. So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men. Women feel chronically less powerful than men  so this is not surprising. But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating  and how well they were participating. And this is really important in the MBA classroom  because participation counts for half the grade. So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap. You get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades  and it seems to be partly attributable to participation. So I started to wonder  you know  okay  so you have these people coming in like this  and they're participating. Is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more  So my main collaborator Dana Carney  who's at Berkeley  and I really wanted to know  can you fake it till you make it  Like  can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful  So we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us. There's a lot of evidence. But our question really was  do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves  There's some evidence that they do. So  for example  we smile when we feel happy  but also  when we're forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this  it makes us feel happy. So it goes both ways. When it comes to power  it also goes both ways. So when you feel powerful  you're more likely to do this  but it's also possible that when you pretend to be powerful  you are more likely to actually feel powerful. So the second question really was  you know  so we know that our minds change our bodies  but is it also true that our bodies change our minds  And when I say minds  in the case of the powerful  what am I talking about  So I'm talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings  and in my case  that's hormones. I look at hormones. So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like  So powerful people tend to be  not surprisingly  more assertive and more confident  more optimistic. They actually feel they're going to win even at games of chance. They also tend to be able to think more abstractly. So there are a lot of differences. They take more risks. There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people. Physiologically  there also are differences on two key hormones  testosterone  which is the dominance hormone  and cortisol  which is the stress hormone. So what we find is that high power alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol  and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol. So what does that mean  When you think about power  people tended to think only about testosterone  because that was about dominance. But really  power is also about how you react to stress. So do you want the high power leader that's dominant  high on testosterone  but really stress reactive  Probably not  right  You want the person who's powerful and assertive and dominant  but not very stress reactive  the person who's laid back. So we know that in primate hierarchies  if an alpha needs to take over  if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly  within a few days  that individual's testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly. So we have this evidence  both that the body can shape the mind  at least at the facial level  and also that role changes can shape the mind. So what happens  okay  you take a role change  what happens if you do that at a really minimal level  like this tiny manipulation  this tiny intervention   For two minutes   you say   I want you to stand like this  and it's going to make you feel more powerful.  So this is what we did. We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment  and these people adopted  for two minutes  either high power poses or low power poses  and I'm just going to show you five of the poses  although they took on only two. So here's one. A couple more. This one has been dubbed the  Wonder Woman  by the media. Here are a couple more. So you can be standing or you can be sitting. And here are the low power poses. So you're folding up  you're making yourself small. This one is very low power. When you're touching your neck  you're really protecting yourself. So this is what happens. They come in  they spit into a vial  for two minutes  we say   You need to do this or this.  They don't look at pictures of the poses. We don't want to prime them with a concept of power. We want them to be feeling power. So two minutes they do this. We then ask them   How powerful do you feel   on a series of items  and then we give them an opportunity to gamble  and then we take another saliva sample. That's it. That's the whole experiment. So this is what we find. Risk tolerance  which is the gambling  we find that when you are in the high power pose condition     percent of you will gamble. When you're in the low power pose condition  only    percent  and that's a whopping significant difference. Here's what we find on testosterone. From their baseline when they come in  high power people experience about a    percent increase  and low power people experience about a    percent decrease. So again  two minutes  and you get these changes. Here's what you get on cortisol. High power people experience about a    percent decrease  and the low power people experience about a    percent increase. So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive  confident and comfortable  or really stress reactive  and feeling sort of shut down. And we've all had the feeling  right  So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves  so it's not just others  but it's also ourselves. Also  our bodies change our minds. But the next question  of course  is  can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways  This is in the lab  it's this little task  it's just a couple of minutes. Where can you actually apply this  Which we cared about  of course. And so we think where you want to use this is evaluative situations  like social threat situations. Where are you being evaluated  either by your friends  For teenagers  it's at the lunchroom table. For some people it's speaking at a school board meeting. It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview. We decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through  was the job interview. So we published these findings  and the media are all over it  and they say  Okay  so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview  right  You know  so we were of course horrified  and said  Oh my God  no  that's not what we meant at all. For numerous reasons  no  don't do that. Again  this is not about you talking to other people. It's you talking to yourself. What do you do before you go into a job interview  You do this. You're sitting down. You're looking at your iPhone    or your Android  not trying to leave anyone out. You're looking at your notes  you're hunching up  making yourself small  when really what you should be doing maybe is this  like  in the bathroom  right  Do that. Find two minutes. So that's what we want to test. Okay  So we bring people into a lab  and they do either high  or low power poses again  they go through a very stressful job interview. It's five minutes long. They are being recorded. They're being judged also  and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback  so they look like this. Imagine this is the person interviewing you. So for five minutes  nothing  and this is worse than being heckled. People hate this. It's what Marianne LaFrance calls  standing in social quicksand.  So this really spikes your cortisol. So this is the job interview we put them through  because we really wanted to see what happened. We then have these coders look at these tapes  four of them. They're blind to the hypothesis. They're blind to the conditions. They have no idea who's been posing in what pose  and they end up looking at these sets of tapes  and they say   We want to hire these people   all the high power posers.  We don't want to hire these people. We also evaluate these people much more positively overall.  But what's driving it  It's not about the content of the speech. It's about the presence that they're bringing to the speech. Because we rate them on all these variables related to competence  like  how well structured is the speech  How good is it  What are their qualifications  No effect on those things. This is what's affected. These kinds of things. People are bringing their true selves  basically. They're bringing themselves. They bring their ideas  but as themselves  with no  you know  residue over them. So this is what's driving the effect  or mediating the effect. So when I tell people about this  that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior  and our behavior can change our outcomes  they say to me   It feels fake.  Right  So I said  fake it till you make it. It's not me. I don't want to get there and then still feel like a fraud. I don't want to feel like an impostor. I don't want to get there only to feel like I'm not supposed to be here. And that really resonated with me  because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor and feeling like I'm not supposed to be here. When I was     I was in a really bad car accident. I was thrown out of a car  rolled several times. I was thrown from the car. And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward  and I had been withdrawn from college  and I learned that my IQ had dropped by two standard deviations  which was very traumatic. I knew my IQ because I had identified with being smart  and I had been called gifted as a child. So I'm taken out of college  I keep trying to go back. They say   You're not going to finish college. Just  you know  there are other things for you to do  but that's not going to work out for you.  So I really struggled with this  and I have to say  having your identity taken from you  your core identity  and for me it was being smart  having that taken from you  there's nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that. So I felt entirely powerless. I worked and worked  and I got lucky  and worked  and got lucky  and worked. Eventually I graduated from college. It took me four years longer than my peers  and I convinced someone  my angel advisor  Susan Fiske  to take me on  and so I ended up at Princeton  and I was like  I am not supposed to be here. I am an impostor. And the night before my first year talk  and the first year talk at Princeton is a    minute talk to    people. That's it. I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said   I'm quitting.  She was like   You are not quitting  because I took a gamble on you  and you're staying. You're going to stay  and this is what you're going to do. You are going to fake it. You're going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do. You're just going to do it and do it and do it  even if you're terrified and just paralyzed and having an out of body experience  until you have this moment where you say  'Oh my gosh  I'm doing it. Like  I have become this. I am actually doing this.'  So that's what I did. Five years in grad school  a few years  you know  I'm at Northwestern  I moved to Harvard  I'm at Harvard  I'm not really thinking about it anymore  but for a long time I had been thinking   Not supposed to be here.  So at the end of my first year at Harvard  a student who had not talked in class the entire semester  who I had said   Look  you've gotta participate or else you're going to fail   came into my office. I really didn't know her at all. She came in totally defeated  and she said   I'm not supposed to be here.  And that was the moment for me. Because two things happened. One was that I realized  oh my gosh  I don't feel like that anymore. I don't feel that anymore  but she does  and I get that feeling. And the second was  she is supposed to be here  Like  she can fake it  she can become it. So I was like   Yes  you are  You are supposed to be here  And tomorrow you're going to fake it  you're going to make yourself powerful  and  you know    And you're going to go into the classroom  and you are going to give the best comment ever.  You know  And she gave the best comment ever  and people turned around and were like  oh my God  I didn't even notice her sitting there.  Laughter  She comes back to me months later  and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it  she had actually faked it till she became it. So she had changed. And so I want to say to you  don't fake it till you make it. Fake it till you become it. Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize. The last thing I'm going to leave you with is this. Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes. So  this is two minutes. Two minutes  two minutes  two minutes. Before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation  for two minutes  try doing this  in the elevator  in a bathroom stall  at your desk behind closed doors. That's what you want to do. Configure your brain to cope the best in that situation. Get your testosterone up. Get your cortisol down. Don't leave that situation feeling like  oh  I didn't show them who I am. Leave that situation feeling like  I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am. So I want to ask you first  you know  both to try power posing  and also I want to ask you to share the science  because this is simple. I don't have ego involved in this.  Laughter  Give it away. Share it with people  because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power. Give it to them because they can do it in private. They need their bodies  privacy and two minutes  and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life. Thank you. Thank you very much.  Applause  Thank you. It's a distinct privilege to be here. A few weeks ago  I saw a video on YouTube of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords at the early stages of her recovery from one of those awful bullets. This one entered her left hemisphere  and knocked out her Broca's area  the speech center of her brain. And in this session  Gabby's working with a speech therapist  and she's struggling to produce some of the most basic words  and you can see her growing more and more devastated  until she ultimately breaks down into sobbing tears  and she starts sobbing wordlessly into the arms of her therapist. And after a few moments  her therapist tries a new tack  and they start singing together  and Gabby starts to sing through her tears  and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate the words to a song that describe the way she feels  and she sings  in one descending scale  she sings   Let it shine  let it shine  let it shine.  And it's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how the beauty of music has the ability to speak where words fail  in this case literally speak. Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug  one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard  and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called Melodic Intonation Therapy  which has become very popular in music therapy now. Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic  could not form sentences of three  or four word sentences  but they could still sing the lyrics to a song  whether it was  Happy Birthday To You  or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones. And after    hours of intensive singing lessons  he found that the music was able to literally rewire the brains of his patients and create a homologous speech center in their right hemisphere to compensate for the left hemisphere's damage. When I was     I visited Dr. Schlaug's lab  and in one afternoon he walked me through some of the leading research on music and the brain    how musicians had fundamentally different brain structure than non musicians  how music  and listening to music  could just light up the entire brain  from our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum  how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality to help children with autism  to help people struggling with stress and anxiety and depression  how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor and their gait would steady when they listened to music  and how late stage Alzheimer's patients  whose dementia was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize their family  could still pick out a tune by Chopin at the piano that they had learned when they were children. But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug  and it was this  that I was at a crossroads in my life  trying to choose between music and medicine. I had just completed my undergraduate  and I was working as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe  studying Parkinson's disease at Harvard  and I had fallen in love with neuroscience. I wanted to become a surgeon. I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes  these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia and work with AIDS patients with multidrug resistant tuberculosis  or with children with disfiguring cancers. I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor  that doctor without borders. On the other hand  I had played the violin my entire life. Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession. It was oxygen. I was lucky enough to have studied at the Juilliard School in Manhattan  and to have played my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv  and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory  but had given up his love for music to pursue a career in medicine. And that afternoon  I had to ask him   How was it for you making that decision   And he said that there were still times when he wished he could go back and play the organ the way he used to  and that for me  medical school could wait  but that the violin simply would not. And after two more years of studying music  I decided to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT and applying to medical school like a good Indian son to become the next Dr. Gupta.  Laughter  And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic. It was my first audition  and after three days of playing behind a screen in a trial week  I was offered the position. And it was a dream. It was a wild dream to perform in an orchestra  to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel  but much more importantly to me to be surrounded by musicians and mentors that became my new family  my new musical home. But a year later  I met another musician who had also studied at Juilliard  one who profoundly helped me find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician. Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard  but he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early   s  was treated with thorazine at Bellevue  and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles    years later. Nathaniel's story has become a beacon for homelessness and mental health advocacy throughout the United States  as told through the book and the movie  The Soloist   but I became his friend  and I became his violin teacher  and I told him that wherever he had his violin  and wherever I had mine  I would play a lesson with him. And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row  I witnessed how music was able to bring him back from his very darkest moments  from what seemed to me in my untrained eye to be the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode. Playing for Nathaniel  the music took on a deeper meaning  because now it was about communication  a communication where words failed  a communication of a message that went deeper than words  that registered at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel's psyche  yet came as a true musical offering from me. I found myself growing outraged that someone like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row because of his mental illness  yet how many tens of thousands of others there were out there on Skid Row alone who had stories as tragic as his  but were never going to have a book or a movie made about them that got them off the streets  And at the very core of this crisis of mine  I felt somehow the life of music had chosen me  where somehow  perhaps possibly in a very naive sense  I felt what Skid Row really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill. But in the end  it was Nathaniel who showed me that if I was truly passionate about change  if I wanted to make a difference  I already had the perfect instrument to do it  that music was the bridge that connected my world and his. There's a beautiful quote by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann  who said   To send light into the darkness of men's hearts  such is the duty of the artist.  And this is a particularly poignant quote because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia and died in asylum. And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel  I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians called Street Symphony  bringing the light of music into the very darkest places  performing for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics on Skid Row  performing for combat veterans with post traumatic stress disorder  and for the incarcerated and those labeled as criminally insane. After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital in San Bernardino  a woman walked up to us and she had tears streaming down her face  and she had a palsy  she was shaking  and she had this gorgeous smile  and she said that she had never heard classical music before  she didn't think she was going to like it  she had never heard a violin before  but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine  and that nobody ever came to visit them  and that for the first time in six years  when she heard us play  she stopped shaking without medication. Suddenly  what we're finding with these concerts  away from the stage  away from the footlights  out of the tuxedo tails  the musicians become the conduit for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits of music on the brain to an audience that would never have access to this room  would never have access to the kind of music that we make. Just as medicine serves to heal more than the building blocks of the body alone  the power and beauty of music transcends the  E  in the middle of our beloved acronym. Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone. The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we hear an opera by Wagner  or a symphony by Brahms  or chamber music by Beethoven  compels us to remember our shared  common humanity  the deeply communal connected consciousness  the empathic consciousness that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard wired into our brain's right hemisphere. And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions of mental illness within homelessness and incarceration  the music and the beauty of music offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them  to remember that they still have the capacity to experience something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them. And the spark of that beauty  the spark of that humanity transforms into hope  and we know  whether we choose the path of music or of medicine  that's the very first thing we must instill within our communities  within our audiences  if we want to inspire healing from within. I'd like to end with a quote by John Keats  the Romantic English poet  a very famous quote that I'm sure all of you know. Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine to pursue poetry  but he died when he was a year older than me. And Keats said   Beauty is truth  and truth beauty. That is all ye know on Earth  and all ye need to know.  We most certainly do talk to terrorists  no question about it. We are at war with a new form of terrorism. It's sort of the good old  traditional form of terrorism  but it's sort of been packaged for the   st century. One of the big things about countering terrorism is  how do you perceive it  Because perception leads to your response to it. So if you have a traditional perception of terrorism  it would be that it's one of criminality  one of war. So how are you going to respond to it  Naturally  it would follow that you meet kind with kind. You fight it. If you have a more modernist approach  and your perception of terrorism is almost cause and effect  then naturally from that  the responses that come out of it are much more asymmetrical. We live in a modern  global world. Terrorists have actually adapted to it. It's something we have to  too  and that means the people who are working on counterterrorism responses have to start  in effect  putting on their Google tinted glasses  or whatever. For my part  what I wanted us to do was just to look at terrorism as though it was a global brand  say  Coca Cola. Both are fairly bad for your health.  Laughter  If you look at it as a brand in those ways  what you'll come to realize is  it's a pretty flawed product. As we've said  it's pretty bad for your health  it's bad for those who it affects  and it's not actually good if you're a suicide bomber either. It doesn't actually do what it says on the tin. You're not really going to get    virgins in heaven. It's not going to happen  I don't think. And you're not really going to  in the '  s  end capitalism by supporting one of these groups. It's a load of nonsense. But what you realize  it's got an Achilles' heel. The brand has an Achilles' heel. We've mentioned the health  but it needs consumers to buy into it. The consumers it needs are the terrorist constituency. They're the people who buy into the brand  support them  facilitate them  and they're the people we've got to reach out to. We've got to attack that brand in front of them. There's two essential ways of doing that  if we carry on this brand theme. One is reducing their market. What I mean is  it's their brand against our brand. We've got to compete. We've got to show we're a better product. If I'm trying to show we're a better product  I probably wouldn't do things like Guantanamo Bay. We've talked there about curtailing the underlying need for the product itself. You could be looking there at poverty  injustice  all those sorts of things which feed terrorism. The other thing to do is to knock the product  attack the brand myth  as we've said. You know  there's nothing heroic about killing a young kid. Perhaps we need to focus on that and get that message back across. We've got to reveal the dangers in the product. Our target audience  it's not just the producers of terrorism  as I've said  the terrorists. It's not just the marketeers of terrorism  which is those who finance  those who facilitate it  but it's the consumers of terrorism. We've got to get in to those homelands. That's where they recruit from. That's where they get their power and strength. That's where their consumers come from. And we have to get our messaging in there. So the essentials are  we've got to have interaction in those areas  with the terrorists  the facilitators  etc. We've got to engage  we've got to educate  and we've got to have dialogue. Now  staying on this brand thing for just a few more seconds  think about delivery mechanisms. How are we going to do these attacks  Well  reducing the market is really one for governments and civil society. We've got to show we're better. We've got to show our values. We've got to practice what we preach. But when it comes to knocking the brand  if the terrorists are Coca Cola and we're Pepsi  I don't think  being Pepsi  anything we say about Coca Cola  anyone's going to believe us. So we've got to find a different mechanism  and one of the best mechanisms I've ever come across is the victims of terrorism. They are somebody who can actually stand there and say   This product's crap. I had it and I was sick for days. It burnt my hand  whatever.  You believe them. You can see their scars. You trust them. But whether it's victims  whether it's governments  NGOs  or even the Queen yesterday  in Northern Ireland  we have to interact and engage with those different layers of terrorism  and  in effect  we do have to have a little dance with the devil. This is my favorite part of my speech. I wanted to blow you all up to try and make a point  but    Laughter    TED  for health and safety reasons  have told me I've got to do a countdown  so I feel like a bit of an Irish or Jewish terrorist  sort of a health and safety terrorist  and I    Laughter    I've got to count          and it's a bit alarming  so thinking of what my motto would be  and it would be   Body parts  not heart attacks.  So        .  Explosion sound  Very good.  Laughter  Now  lady in   J was a suicide bomber amongst us all. We're all victims of terrorism. There's     of us in this room. We're going to be scarred for life. There was a father and a son who sat in that seat over there. The son's dead. The father lives. The father will probably kick himself for years to come that he didn't take that seat instead of his kid. He's going to take to alcohol  and he's probably going to kill himself in three years. That's the stats. There's a very young  attractive lady over here  and she has something which I think's the worst form of psychological  physical injury I've ever seen out of a suicide bombing  It's human shrapnel. What it means is  when she sat in a restaurant in years to come     years to come     years to come  or she's on the beach  every so often she's going to start rubbing her skin  and out of there will come a piece of that shrapnel. And that is a hard thing for the head to take. There's a lady over there as well who lost her legs in this bombing. She's going to find out that she gets a pitiful amount of money off our government for looking after what's happened to her. She had a daughter who was going to go to one of the best universities. She's going to give up university to look after Mum. We're all here  and all of those who watch it are going to be traumatized by this event  but all of you here who are victims are going to learn some hard truths. That is  our society  we sympathize  but after a while  we start to ignore. We don't do enough as a society. We do not look after our victims  and we do not enable them  and what I'm going to try and show is that actually  victims are the best weapon we have against more terrorism. How would the government at the turn of the millennium approach today  Well  we all know. What they'd have done then is an invasion. If the suicide bomber was from Wales  good luck to Wales  I'd say. Knee jerk legislation  emergency provision legislation    which hits at the very basis of our society  as we all know    it's a mistake. We're going to drive prejudice throughout Edinburgh  throughout the U.K.  for Welsh people. Today's approach  governments have learned from their mistakes. They are looking at what I've started off on  on these more asymmetrical approaches to it  more modernist views  cause and effect. But mistakes of the past are inevitable. It's human nature. The fear and the pressure to do something on them is going to be immense. They are going to make mistakes. They're not just going to be smart. There was a famous Irish terrorist who once summed up the point very beautifully. He said   The thing is  about the British government  is  is that it's got to be lucky all the time  and we only have to be lucky once.  So what we need to do is we have to effect it. We've got to start thinking about being more proactive. We need to build an arsenal of noncombative weapons in this war on terrorism. But of course  it's ideas    is not something that governments do very well. I want to go back just to before the bang  to this idea of brand  and I was talking about Coke and Pepsi  etc. We see it as terrorism versus democracy in that brand war. They'll see it as freedom fighters and truth against injustice  imperialism  etc. We do have to see this as a deadly battlefield. It's not just  our  flesh and blood they want. They actually want our cultural souls  and that's why the brand analogy is a very interesting way of looking at this. If we look at al Qaeda. Al Qaeda was essentially a product on a shelf in a souk somewhere which not many people had heard of.      launched it. It was its big marketing day  and it was packaged for the   st century. They knew what they were doing. They were effectively  doing  something in this brand image of creating a brand which can be franchised around the world  where there's poverty  ignorance and injustice. We  as I've said  have got to hit that market  but we've got to use our heads rather than our might. If we perceive it in this way as a brand  or other ways of thinking at it like this  we will not resolve or counter terrorism. What I'd like to do is just briefly go through a few examples from my work on areas where we try and approach these things differently. The first one has been dubbed  lawfare   for want of a better word. When we originally looked at bringing civil actions against terrorists  everyone thought we were a bit mad and mavericks and crackpots. Now it's got a title. Everyone's doing it. There's a bomb  people start suing. But one of the first early cases on this was the Omagh Bombing. A civil action was brought from     . In Omagh  bomb went off  Real IRA  middle of a peace process. That meant that the culprits couldn't really be prosecuted for lots of reasons  mostly to do with the peace process and what was going on  the greater good. It also meant  then  if you can imagine this  that the people who bombed your children and your husbands were walking around the supermarket that you lived in. Some of those victims said enough is enough. We brought a private action  and thank God     years later  we actually won it. There is a slight appeal on at the moment so I have to be a bit careful  but I'm fairly confident. Why was it effective  It was effective not just because justice was seen to be done where there was a huge void. It was because the Real IRA and other terrorist groups  their whole strength is from the fact that they are an underdog. When we put the victims as the underdog and flipped it  they didn't know what to do. They were embarrassed. Their recruitment went down. The bombs actually stopped    fact    because of this action. We became  or those victims became  more importantly  a ghost that haunted the terrorist organization. There's other examples. We have a case called Almog which is to do with a bank that was  allegedly  from our point of view  giving rewards to suicide bombers. Just by bringing the very action  that bank has stopped doing it  and indeed  the powers that be around the world  which for real politic reasons before  couldn't actually deal with this issue  because there was lots of competing interests  have actually closed down those loopholes in the banking system. There's another case called the McDonald case  where some victims of Semtex  of the Provisional IRA bombings  which were supplied by Gaddafi  sued  and that action has led to amazing things for new Libya. New Libya has been compassionate towards those victims  and started taking it    so it started a whole new dialogue there. But the problem is  we need more and more support for these ideas and cases. Civil affairs and civil society initiatives. A good one is in Somalia. There's a war on piracy. If anyone thinks you can have a war on piracy like a war on terrorism and beat it  you're wrong. What we're trying to do there is turn pirates to fisherman. They used to be fisherman  of course  but we stole their fish and dumped a load of toxic waste in their water  so what we're trying to do is create security and employment by bringing a coastguard along with the fisheries industry  and I can guarantee you  as that builds  al Shabaab and such likes will not have the poverty and injustice any longer to prey on those people. These initiatives cost less than a missile  and certainly less than any soldier's life  but more importantly  it takes the war to their homelands  and not onto our shore  and we're looking at the causes. The last one I wanted to talk about was dialogue. The advantages of dialogue are obvious. It self educates both sides  enables a better understanding  reveals the strengths and weaknesses  and yes  like some of the speakers before  the shared vulnerability does lead to trust  and it does then become  that process  part of normalization. But it's not an easy road. After the bomb  the victims are not into this. There's practical problems. It's politically risky for the protagonists and for the interlocutors. On one occasion I was doing it  every time I did a point that they didn't like  they actually threw stones at me  and when I did a point they liked  they starting shooting in the air  equally not great.  Laughter  Whatever the point  it gets to the heart of the problem  you're doing it  you're talking to them. Now  I just want to end with saying  if we follow reason  we realize that I think we'd all say that we want to have a perception of terrorism which is not just a pure military perception of it. We need to foster more modern and asymmetrical responses to it. This isn't about being soft on terrorism. It's about fighting them on contemporary battlefields. We must foster innovation  as I've said. Governments are receptive. It won't come from those dusty corridors. The private sector has a role. The role we could do right now is going away and looking at how we can support victims around the world to bring initiatives. If I was to leave you with some big questions here which may change one's perception to it  and who knows what thoughts and responses will come out of it  but did myself and my terrorist group actually need to blow you up to make our point  We have to ask ourselves these questions  however unpalatable. Have we been ignoring an injustice or a humanitarian struggle somewhere in the world  What if  actually  engagement on poverty and injustice is exactly what the terrorists wanted us to do  What if the bombs are just simply wake up calls for us  What happens if that bomb went off because we didn't have any thoughts and things in place to allow dialogue to deal with these things and interaction  What is definitely uncontroversial is that  as I've said  we've got to stop being reactive  and more proactive  and I just want to leave you with one idea  which is that it's a provocative question for you to think about  and the answer will require sympathy with the devil. It's a question that's been tackled by many great thinkers and writers  What if society actually needs crisis to change  What if society actually needs terrorism to change and adapt for the better  It's those Bulgakov themes  it's that picture of Jesus and the Devil hand in hand in Gethsemane walking into the moonlight. What it would mean is that humans  in order to survive in development  quite Darwinian spirit here  inherently must dance with the devil. A lot of people say that communism was defeated by the Rolling Stones. It's a good theory. Maybe the Rolling Stones has a place in this. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Thank you.  Applause  So  this is my grandfather  Salman Schocken  who was born into a poor and uneducated family with six children to feed  and when he was    years old  he was forced to drop out of school in order to help put bread on the table. He never went back to school. Instead  he went on to build a glittering empire of department stores. Salman was the consummate perfectionist  and every one of his stores was a jewel of Bauhaus architecture. He was also the ultimate self learner  and like everything else  he did it in grand style. He surrounded himself with an entourage of young  unknown scholars like Martin Buber and Shai Agnon and Franz Kafka  and he paid each one of them a monthly salary so that they could write in peace. And yet  in the late '  s  Salman saw what's coming. He fled Germany  together with his family  leaving everything else behind. His department stores confiscated  he spent the rest of his life in a relentless pursuit of art and culture. This high school dropout died at the age of     a formidable intellectual  cofounder and first CEO of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem  and founder of Schocken Books  an acclaimed imprint that was later acquired by Random House. Such is the power of self study. And these are my parents. They too did not enjoy the privilege of college education. They were too busy building a family and a country. And yet  just like Salman  they were lifelong  tenacious self learners  and our home was stacked with thousands of books  records and artwork. I remember quite vividly my father telling me that when everyone in the neighborhood will have a TV set  then we'll buy a normal F.M. radio.  Laughter  And that's me  I was going to say holding my first abacus  but actually holding what my father would consider an ample substitute to an iPad.  Laughter  So one thing that I took from home is this notion that educators don't necessarily have to teach. Instead  they can provide an environment and resources that tease out your natural ability to learn on your own. Self study  self exploration  self empowerment  these are the virtues of a great education. So I'd like to share with you a story about a self study  self empowering computer science course that I built  together with my brilliant colleague Noam Nisan. As you can see from the pictures  both Noam and I had an early fascination with first principles  and over the years  as our knowledge of science and technology became more sophisticated  this early awe with the basics has only intensified. So it's not surprising that  about    years ago  when Noam and I were already computer science professors  we were equally frustrated by the same phenomenon. As computers became increasingly more complex  our students were losing the forest for the trees  and indeed  it is impossible to connect with the soul of the machine if you interact with a black box P.C. or a Mac which is shrouded by numerous layers of closed  proprietary software. So Noam and I had this insight that if we want our students to understand how computers work  and understand it in the marrow of their bones  then perhaps the best way to go about it is to have them build a complete  working  general purpose  useful computer  hardware and software  from the ground up  from first principles. Now  we had to start somewhere  and so Noam and I decided to base our cathedral  so to speak  on the simplest possible building block  which is something called NAND. It is nothing more than a trivial logic gate with four input output states. So we now start this journey by telling our students that God gave us NAND    Laughter    and told us to build a computer  and when we asked how  God said   One step at a time.  And then  following this advice  we start with this lowly  humble NAND gate  and we walk our students through an elaborate sequence of projects in which they gradually build a chip set  a hardware platform  an assembler  a virtual machine  a basic operating system and a compiler for a simple  Java like language that we call  JACK.  The students celebrate the end of this tour de force by using JACK to write all sorts of cool games like Pong  Snake and Tetris. You can imagine the tremendous joy of playing with a Tetris game that you wrote in JACK and then compiled into machine language in a compiler that you wrote also  and then seeing the result running on a machine that you built starting with nothing more than a few thousand NAND gates. It's a tremendous personal triumph of going from first principles all the way to a fantastically complex and useful system. Noam and I worked five years to facilitate this ascent and to create the tools and infrastructure that will enable students to build it in one semester. And this is the great team that helped us make it happen. The trick was to decompose the computer's construction into numerous stand alone modules  each of which could be individually specified  built and unit tested in isolation from the rest of the project. And from day one  Noam and I decided to put all these building blocks freely available in open source on the Web. So chip specifications  APIs  project descriptions  software tools  hardware simulators  CPU emulators  stacks of hundreds of slides  lectures    we laid out everything on the Web and invited the world to come over  take whatever they need  and do whatever they want with it. And then something fascinating happened. The world came. And in short order  thousands of people were building our machine. And NAND Tetris became one of the first massive  open  online courses  although seven years ago we had no idea that what we were doing is called MOOCs. We just observed how self organized courses were kind of spontaneously spawning out of our materials. For example  Pramode C.E.  an engineer from Kerala  India  has organized groups of self learners who build our computer under his good guidance. And Parag Shah  another engineer  from Mumbai  has unbundled our projects into smaller  more manageable bites that he now serves in his pioneering do it yourself computer science program. The people who are attracted to these courses typically have a hacker mentality. They want to figure out how things work  and they want to do it in groups  like this hackers club in Washington  D.C.  that uses our materials to offer community courses. And because these materials are widely available and open source  different people take them to very different and unpredictable directions. For example  Yu Fangmin  from Guangzhou  has used FPGA technology to build our computer and show others how to do the same using a video clip  and Ben Craddock developed a very nice computer game that unfolds inside our CPU architecture  which is quite a complex  D maze that Ben developed using the Minecraft  D simulator engine. The Minecraft community went bananas over this project  and Ben became an instant media celebrity. And indeed  for quite a few people  taking this NAND Tetris pilgrimage  if you will  has turned into a life changing experience. For example  take Dan Rounds  who is a music and math major from East Lansing  Michigan. A few weeks ago  Dan posted a victorious post on our website  and I'd like to read it to you. So here's what Dan said.  I did the coursework because understanding computers is important to me  just like literacy and numeracy  and I made it through. I never worked harder on anything  never been challenged to this degree. But given what I now feel capable of doing  I would certainly do it again. To anyone considering NAND Tetris  it's a tough journey  but you'll be profoundly changed.  So Dan demonstrates the many self learners who take this course off the Web  on their own traction  on their own initiative  and it's quite amazing because these people cannot care less about grades. They are doing it because of one motivation only. They have a tremendous passion to learn. And with that in mind  I'd like to say a few words about traditional college grading. I'm sick of it. We are obsessed with grades because we are obsessed with data  and yet grading takes away all the fun from failing  and a huge part of education is about failing. Courage  according to Churchill  is the ability to go from one defeat to another without losing enthusiasm.  Laughter  And  Joyce  said that mistakes are the portals of discovery. And yet we don't tolerate mistakes  and we worship grades. So we collect your B pluses and your A minuses and we aggregate them into a number like  .   which is stamped on your forehead and sums up who you are. Well  in my opinion  we went too far with this nonsense  and grading became degrading. So with that  I'd like to say a few words about upgrading  and share with you a glimpse from my current project  which is different from the previous one  but it shares exactly the same characteristics of self learning  learning by doing  self exploration and community building  and this project deals with K    math education  beginning with early age math  and we do it on tablets because we believe that math  like anything else  should be taught hands on. So here's what we do. Basically  we developed numerous mobile apps  every one of them explaining a particular concept in math. So for example  let's take area. When you deal with a concept like area    well  we also provide a set of tools that the child is invited to experiment with in order to learn. So if area is what interests us  then one thing which is natural to do is to tile the area of this particular shape and simply count how many tiles it takes to cover it completely. And this little exercise here gives you a first good insight of the notion of area. Moving along  what about the area of this figure  Well  if you try to tile it  it doesn't work too well  does it. So instead  you can experiment with these different tools here by some process of guided trial and error  and at some point you will discover that one thing that you can do among several legitimate transformations is the following one. You can cut the figure  you can rearrange the parts  you can glue them and then proceed to tile just like we did before. Now this particular transformation did not change the area of the original figure  so a six year old who plays with this has just discovered a clever algorithm to compute the area of any given parallelogram. We don't replace teachers  by the way. We believe that teachers should be empowered  not replaced. Moving along  what about the area of a triangle  So after some guided trial and error  the child will discover  with or without help  that he or she can duplicate the original figure and then take the result  transpose it  glue it to the original and then proceed  with  what we did before  cut  rearrange  paste   oops  paste and glue  and tile. Now this transformation has doubled the area of the original figure  and therefore we have just learned that the area of the triangle equals the area of this rectangle divided by two. But we discovered it by self exploration. So  in addition to learning some useful geometry  the child has been exposed to some pretty sophisticated science strategies  like reduction  which is the art of transforming a complex problem into a simple one  or generalization  which is at the heart of any scientific discipline  or the fact that some properties are invariant under some transformations. And all this is something that a very young child can pick up using such mobile apps. So presently  we are doing the following  First of all  we are decomposing the K    math curriculum into numerous such apps. And because we cannot do it on our own  we've developed a very fancy authoring tool that any author  any parent or actually anyone who has an interest in math education  can use this authoring tool to develop similar apps on tablets without programming. And finally  we are putting together an adaptive ecosystem that will match different learners with different apps according to their evolving learning style. The driving force behind this project is my colleague Shmulik London  and  you see  just like Salman did about    years ago  the trick is to surround yourself with brilliant people  because at the end  it's all about people. And a few years ago  I was walking in Tel Aviv and I saw this graffiti on a wall  and I found it so compelling that by now I preach it to my students  and I'd like to try to preach it to you. Now  I don't know how many people here are familiar with the term  mensch.  It basically means to be human and to do the right thing. And with that  what this graffiti says is   High tech schmigh tech. The most important thing is to be a mensch.   Laughter  Thank you.  Applause  When I was considering a career in the art world  I took a course in London  and one of my supervisors was this irascible Italian called Pietro  who drank too much  smoked too much and swore much too much. But he was a passionate teacher  and I remember one of our earlier classes with him  he was projecting images on the wall  asking us to think about them  and he put up an image of a painting. It was a landscape with figures  semi dressed  drinking wine. There was a nude woman in the lower foreground  and on the hillside in the back  there was a figure of the mythological god Bacchus  and he said   What is this   And I    no one else did  so I put up my hand  and I said   It's a Bacchanal by Titian.  He said   It's a what   I thought maybe I'd pronounced it wrong.  It's a Bacchanal by Titian.  He said   It's a what   I said   It's a Bacchanal by Titian.   Laughter  He said   You boneless bookworm  It's a fucking orgy   As I said  he swore too much. There was an important lesson for me in that. Pietro was suspicious of formal art training  art history training  because he feared that it filled people up with jargon  and then they just classified things rather than looking at them  and he wanted to remind us that all art was once contemporary  and he wanted us to use our eyes  and he was especially evangelical about this message  because he was losing his sight. He wanted us to look and ask basic questions of objects. What is it  How is it made  Why was it made  How is it used  And these were important lessons to me when I subsequently became a professional art historian. My kind of eureka moment came a few years later  when I was studying the art of the courts of Northern Europe  and of course it was very much discussed in terms of the paintings and the sculptures and the architecture of the day. But as I began to read historical documents and contemporary descriptions  I found there was a kind of a missing component  for everywhere I came across descriptions of tapestries. Tapestries were ubiquitous between the Middle Ages and  really  well into the   th century  and it was pretty apparent why. Tapestries were portable. You could roll them up  send them ahead of you  and in the time it took to hang them up  you could transform a cold  dank interior into a richly colored setting. Tapestries effectively provided a vast canvas on which the patrons of the day could depict the heroes with whom they wanted to be associated  or even themselves  and in addition to that  tapestries were hugely expensive. They required scores of highly skilled weavers working over extended periods of time with very expensive materials    the wools  the silks  even gold and silver thread. So  all in all  in an age when the visual image of any kind was rare  tapestries were an incredibly potent form of propaganda. Well  I became a tapestry historian. In due course  I ended up as a curator at the Metropolitan Museum  because I saw the Met as one of the few places where I could organize really big exhibitions about the subject I cared so passionately about. And in about       the then director Philippe de Montebello gave me the go ahead to organize an exhibition for     . We normally have these very long lead in times. It wasn't straightforward. It's no longer a question of chucking a tapestry in the back of a car. They have to be wound on huge rollers  shipped in oversized freighters. Some of them are so big we had  to get them into the museum  we had to take them up the great steps at the front. We thought very hard about how to present this unknown subject to a modern audience  the dark colors to set off the colors that remained in objects that were often faded  the placing of lights to bring out the silk and the gold thread  the labeling. You know  we live in an age where we are so used to television images and photographs  a one hit image. These were big  complex things  almost like cartoons with multiple narratives. We had to draw our audience in  get them to slow down  to explore the objects. There was a lot of skepticism. On the opening night  I overheard one of the senior members of staff saying   This is going to be a bomb.  But in reality  in the course of the coming weeks and months  hundreds of thousands of people came to see the show. The exhibition was designed to be an experience  and tapestries are hard to reproduce in photographs. So I want you to use your imaginations  thinking of these wall high objects  some of them    meters wide  depicting lavish court scenes with courtiers and dandies who would look quite at home in the pages of the fashion press today  thick woods with hunters crashing through the undergrowth in pursuit of wild boars and deer  violent battles with scenes of fear and heroism. I remember taking my son's school class. He was eight at the time  and all the little boys  they kind of    you know  they were little boys  and then the thing that caught their attention was in one of the hunting scenes there was a dog pooping in the foreground    Laughter    kind of an in your face joke by the artist. And you can just imagine them. But it brought it alive to them. I think they suddenly saw that these weren't just old faded tapestries. These were images of the world in the past  and that it was the same for our audience. And for me as a curator  I felt proud. I felt I'd shifted the needle a little. Through this experience that could only be created in a museum  I'd opened up the eyes of my audience    historians  artists  press  the general public    to the beauty of this lost medium. A few years later  I was invited to be the director of the museum  and after I got over that     Who  me  The tapestry geek  I don't wear a tie      I realized the fact  I believe passionately in that curated museum experience. We live in an age of ubiquitous information  and sort of  just add water  expertise  but there's nothing that compares with the presentation of significant objects in a well told narrative  what the curator does  the interpretation of a complex  esoteric subject  in a way that retains the integrity of the subject  that makes it    unpacks it for a general audience. And that  to me  today  is now the challenge and the fun of my job  supporting the vision of my curators  whether it's an exhibition of Samurai swords  early Byzantine artifacts  Renaissance portraits  or the show we heard mentioned earlier  the McQueen show  with which we enjoyed so much success last summer. That was an interesting case. In the late spring  early summer of       shortly after McQueen's suicide  our curator of costume  Andrew Bolton  came to see me  and said   I've been thinking of doing a show on McQueen  and now is the moment. We have to  we have to do it fast.  It wasn't easy. McQueen had worked throughout his career with a small team of designers and managers who were very protective of his legacy  but Andrew went to London and worked with them over the summer and won their confidence  and that of the designers who created his amazing fashion shows  which were works of performance art in their own right  and we proceeded to do something at the museum  I think  we've never done before. It wasn't just your standard installation. In fact  we ripped down the galleries to recreate entirely different settings  a recreation of his first studio  a hall of mirrors  a curiosity box  a sunken ship  a burned out interior  with videos and soundtracks that ranged from operatic arias to pigs fornicating. And in this extraordinary setting  the costumes were like actors and actresses  or living sculptures. It could have been a train wreck. It could have looked like shop windows on Fifth Avenue at Christmas  but because of the way that Andrew connected with the McQueen team  he was channeling the rawness and the brilliance of McQueen  and the show was quite transcendant  and it became a phenomenon in its own right. By the end of the show  we had people queuing for four or five hours to get into the show  but no one really complained. I heard over and over again   Wow  that was worth it. It was a such a visceral  emotive experience.  Now  I've described two very immersive exhibitions  but I also believe that collections  individual objects  can also have that same power. The Met was set up not as a museum of American art  but of an encyclopedic museum  and today      years later  that vision is as prescient as ever  because  of course  we live in a world of crisis  of challenge  and we're exposed to it through the      newsreels. It's in our galleries that we can unpack the civilizations  the cultures  that we're seeing the current manifestation of. Whether it's Libya  Egypt  Syria  it's in our galleries that we can explain and give greater understanding. I mean  our new Islamic galleries are a case in point  opened    years  almost to the week  after     . I think for most Americans  knowledge of the Islamic world was pretty slight before       and then it was thrust upon us in one of America's darkest hours  and the perception was through the polarization of that terrible event. Now  in our galleries  we show    centuries of the development of different Islamic cultures across a vast geographic spread  and  again  hundreds of thousands of people have come to see these galleries since they opened last October. I'm often asked   Is digital media replacing the museum   and I think those numbers are a resounding rejection of that notion. I mean  don't get me wrong  I'm a huge advocate of the Web. It gives us a way of reaching out to audiences around the globe  but nothing replaces the authenticity of the object presented with passionate scholarship. Bringing people face to face with our objects is a way of bringing them face to face with people across time  across space  whose lives may have been very different to our own  but who  like us  had hopes and dreams  frustrations and achievements in their lives. And I think this is a process that helps us better understand ourselves  helps us make better decisions about where we're going. The Great Hall at the Met is one of the great portals of the world  awe inspiring  like a medieval cathedral. From there  you can walk in any direction to almost any culture. I frequently go out into the hall and the galleries and I watch our visitors coming in. Some of them are comfortable. They feel at home. They know what they're looking for. Others are very uneasy. It's an intimidating place. They feel that the institution is elitist. I'm working to try and break down that sense of that elitism. I want to put people in a contemplative frame of mind  where they're prepared to be a little bit lost  to explore  to see the unfamiliar in the familiar  or to try the unknown. Because for us  it's all about bringing them face to face with great works of art  capturing them at that moment of discomfort  when the inclination is kind of to reach for your iPhone  your Blackberry  but to create a zone where their curiosity can expand. And whether it's in the expression of a Greek sculpture that reminds you of a friend  or a dog pooping in the corner of a tapestry  or  to bring it back to my tutor Pietro  those dancing figures who are indeed knocking back the wine  and that nude figure in the left foreground. Wow. She is a gorgeous embodiment of youthful sexuality. In that moment  our scholarship can tell you that this is a bacchanal  but if we're doing our job right  and you've checked the jargon at the front door  trust your instinct. You know it's an orgy. Thank you.  Applause  Companies are losing control. What happens on Wall Street no longer stays on Wall Street. What happens in Vegas ends up on YouTube.  Laughter  Reputations are volatile. Loyalties are fickle. Management teams seem increasingly disconnected from their staff.  Laughter  A recent survey said that    percent of bosses believe their employees are inspired by their firm. However  in the same survey  only four percent of employees agreed. Companies are losing control of their customers and their employees. But are they really  I'm a marketer  and as a marketer  I know that I've never really been in control. Your brand is what other people say about you when you're not in the room  the saying goes. Hyperconnectivity and transparency allow companies to be in that room now      . They can listen and join the conversation. In fact  they have more control over the loss of control than ever before. They can design for it. But how  First of all  they can give employees and customers more control. They can collaborate with them on the creation of ideas  knowledge  content  designs and product. They can give them more control over pricing  which is what the band Radiohead did with its pay as you like online release of its album  In Rainbows.  Buyers could determine the price  but the offer was exclusive  and only stood for a limited period of time. The album sold more copies than previous releases of the band. The Danish chocolate company Anthon Berg opened a so called  generous store  in Copenhagen. It asked customers to purchase chocolate with the promise of good deeds towards loved ones. It turned transactions into interactions  and generosity into a currency. Companies can even give control to hackers. When Microsoft Kinect came out  the motion controlled add on to its Xbox gaming console  it immediately drew the attention of hackers. Microsoft first fought off the hacks  but then shifted course when it realized that actively supporting the community came with benefits. The sense of co ownership  the free publicity  the added value  all helped drive sales. The ultimate empowerment of customers is to ask them not to buy. Outdoor clothier Patagonia encouraged prospective buyers to check out eBay for its used products and to resole their shoes before purchasing new ones. In an even more radical stance against consumerism  the company placed a  Don't Buy This Jacket  advertisement during the peak of shopping season. It may have jeopardized short term sales  but it builds lasting  long term loyalty based on shared values. Research has shown that giving employees more control over their work makes them happier and more productive. The Brazilian company Semco Group famously lets employees set their own work schedules and even their salaries. Hulu and Netflix  among other companies  have open vacation policies. Companies can give people more control  but they can also give them less control. Traditional business wisdom holds that trust is earned by predictable behavior  but when everything is consistent and standardized  how do you create meaningful experiences  Giving people less control might be a wonderful way to counter the abundance of choice and make them happier. Take the travel service Nextpedition. Nextpedition turns the trip into a game  with surprising twists and turns along the way. It does not tell the traveler where she's going until the very last minute  and information is provided just in time. Similarly  Dutch airline KLM launched a surprise campaign  seemingly randomly handing out small gifts to travelers en route to their destination. U.K. based Interflora monitored Twitter for users who were having a bad day  and then sent them a free bouquet of flowers. Is there anything companies can do to make their employees feel less pressed for time  Yes. Force them to help others. A recent study suggests that having employees complete occasional altruistic tasks throughout the day increases their sense of overall productivity. At Frog  the company I work for  we hold internal speed meet sessions that connect old and new employees  helping them get to know each other fast. By applying a strict process  we give them less control  less choice  but we enable more and richer social interactions. Companies are the makers of their fortunes  and like all of us  they are utterly exposed to serendipity. That should make them more humble  more vulnerable and more human. At the end of the day  as hyperconnectivity and transparency expose companies' behavior in broad daylight  staying true to their true selves is the only sustainable value proposition. Or as the ballet dancer Alonzo King said   What's interesting about you is you.  For the true selves of companies to come through  openness is paramount  but radical openness is not a solution  because when everything is open  nothing is open.  A smile is a door that is half open and half closed   the author Jennifer Egan wrote. Companies can give their employees and customers more control or less. They can worry about how much openness is good for them  and what needs to stay closed. Or they can simply smile  and remain open to all possibilities. Thank you.  Applause  I have to say that I'm very glad to be here. I understand we have over    countries here  so that's a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries. In each country  I'm sure you have this thing called the parent teacher conference. Do you know about the parent teacher conference  Not the ones for your kids  but the one you had as a child  where your parents come to school and your teacher talks to your parents  and it's a little bit awkward. Well  I remember in third grade  I had this moment where my father  who never takes off from work  he's a classical blue collar  a working class immigrant person  going to school to see his son  how he's doing  and the teacher said to him  he said   You know  John is good at math and art.  And he kind of nodded  you know  The next day I saw him talking to a customer at our tofu store  and he said   You know  John's good at math.  And that always stuck with me all my life. Why didn't Dad say art  Why wasn't it okay  Why  It became a question my entire life  and that's all right  because being good at math meant he bought me a computer  and some of you remember this computer  this was my first computer. Who had an Apple II  Apple II users  very cool.  Applause  As you remember  the Apple II did nothing at all.  Laughter  You'd plug it in  you'd type in it and green text would come out. It would say you're wrong most of the time. That was the computer we knew. That computer is a computer that I learned about going to MIT  my father's dream. And at MIT  however  I learned about the computer at all levels  and after  I went to art school to get away from computers  and I began to think about the computer as more of a spiritual space of thinking. And I was influenced by performance art    so this is    years ago. I made a computer out of people. It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment. I have a power manager  mouse driver  memory  etc.  and I built this in Kyoto  the old capital of Japan. It's a room broken in two halves. I've turned the computer on  and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard  and it's put into the computer. And the floppy disk drive person wears it.  Laughter  She finds the first sector on the disk  and takes data off the disk and passes it off to  of course  the bus. So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory  to the CPU  the VRAM  etc.  and it's an actual working computer. That's a bus  really.  Laughter  And it looks kind of fast. That's a mouse driver  where it's XY.  Laughter  It looks like it's happening kind of quickly  but it's actually a very slow computer  and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is  it made me wonder about computers and technology in general. And so I'm going to talk today about four things  really. The first three things are about how I've been curious about technology  design and art  and how they intersect  how they overlap  and also a topic that I've taken on since four years ago I became the President of Rhode Island School of Design  leadership. And I'll talk about how I've looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis  a kind of experiment. So starting from technology  technology is a wonderful thing. When that Apple II came out  it really could do nothing. It could show text and after we waited a bit  we had these things called images. Remember when images were first possible with a computer  those gorgeous  full color images  And then after a few years  we got CD quality sound. It was incredible. You could listen to sound on the computer. And then movies  via CD ROM. It was amazing. Remember that excitement  And then the browser appeared. The browser was great  but the browser was very primitive  very narrow bandwidth. Text first  then images  we waited  CD quality sound over the Net  then movies over the Internet. Kind of incredible. And then the mobile phone occurred  text  images  audio  video. And now we have iPhone  iPad  Android  with text  video  audio  etc. You see this little pattern here  We're kind of stuck in a loop  perhaps  and this sense of possibility from computing is something I've been questioning for the last    or so years  and have looked to design  as we understand most things  and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine. And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson. Designers talk about the relationship between form and content  content and form. Now what does that mean  Well  content is the word up there  fear. It's a four letter word. It's a kind of a bad feeling word  fear. Fear is set in Light Helvetica  so it's not too stressful  and if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica  it's like   Oh  fear  who cares   Right   Laughter  You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big  and like  whoa  that hurts. Fear. So you can see how you change the scale  you change the form. Content is the same  but you feel differently. You change the typeface to  like  this typeface  and it's kind of funny. It's like pirate typeface  like Captain Jack Sparrow typeface. Arr  Fear  Like  aww  that's not fearful. That's actually funny. Or fear like this  kind of a nightclub typeface.  Laughter  Like  we gotta go to Fear.  Laughter  It's  like  amazing  right   Laughter   Applause  It just changes the same content. Or you make it    The letters are separated apart  they're huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic  and you feel sorry for the letters  like  I feel the fear. You feel for them. Or you change the typeface to something like this. It's very classy. It's like that expensive restaurant  Fear. I can never get in there.  Laughter  It's just amazing  Fear. But that's form  content. If you just change one letter in that content  you get a much better word  much better content  free.  Free  is a great word. You can serve it almost any way. Free bold feels like Mandela free. It's like  yes  I can be free. Free even light feels kind of like  ah  I can breathe in free. It feels great. Or even free spread out  it's like  ah  I can breathe in free  so easily. And I can add in a blue gradient and a dove  and I have  like  Don Draper free.  Laughter  So you see that    form  content  design  it works that way. It's a powerful thing. It's like magic  almost  like the magicians we've seen at TED. It's magic. Design does that. And I've been curious about how design and technology intersect  and I'm going to show you some old work I never really show anymore  to give you a sense of what I used to do. So    yeah. So I made a lot of work in the '  s. This was a square that responds to sound. People ask me why I made that. It's not clear.  Laughter  But I thought it'd be neat for the square to respond to me  and my kids were small then  and my kids would play with these things  like   Aaah   you know  they would say   Daddy  aaah  aaah.  You know  like that. We'd go to a computer store  and they'd do the same thing. And they'd say   Daddy  why doesn't the computer respond to sound   And it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn't the computer respond to sound  So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time. And then I spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this  and I stopped doing it because my students at MIT got so much better than myself  so I had to hang up my mouse. But in '    I made my last piece. It was in black and white  monochrome  fully monochrome  all in integer mathematics. It's called  Tap  Type  Write.  It's paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary. It has    variations.  Typing noise  There's a shift. Ten variations. This is  like  spin the letter around. This is  like  a ring of letters.  Typing noises  This is    years old  so it's kind of a    Let's see  this is   I love the French film  The Red Balloon.  Great movie  right  I love that movie. So  this is sort of like a play on that.  Typing noises   Typewriter bell  It's peaceful  like that.  Laughter  I'll show this last one. This is about balance  you know. It's kind of stressful typing out  so if you type on this keyboard  you can  like  balance it out. If you hit G  life's okay  so I always say   Hit G  and it's going to be all right. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. So that was    years ago  and I was always on the periphery of art. By being President of RISD I've gone deep into art  and art is a wonderful thing  fine art  pure art. You know  when people say   I don't get art. I don't get it at all.  That means art is working  you know  It's like  art is supposed to be enigmatic  so when you say  like   I don't get it   like  oh  that's great.  Laughter  Art does that  because art is about asking questions  questions that may not be answerable. At RISD  we have this amazing facility called the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab. It has        samples of animal  bone  mineral  plants. You know  in Rhode Island  if an animal gets hit on the road  they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it. And why do we have this facility  Because at RISD  you have to look at the actual animal  the object  to understand its volume  to perceive it. At RISD  you're not allowed to draw from an image. And many people ask me  John  couldn't you just digitize all this  Make it all digital  Wouldn't it be better  And I often say  well  there's something good to how things used to be done. There's something very different about it  something we should figure out what is good about how we did it  even in this new era. And I have a good friend  he's a new media artist named Tota Hasegawa. He's based in London  no  actually it's in Tokyo  but when he was based in London  he had a game with his wife. He would go to antique shops  and the game was as such  When we look at an antique we want  we'll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique  and if it's a good story  we'll buy it. So they'd go to an antique shop  and they'd look at this cup  and they'd say   Tell us about this cup.  And the shopkeeper would say   It's old.   Laughter   Tell us more.   Oh  it's really old.   Laughter  And he saw  over and over  the antique's value was all about it being old. And as a new media artist  he reflected  and said  you know  I've spent my whole career making new media art. People say   Wow  your art  what is it   It's new media. And he realized  it isn't about old or new. It's about something in between. It isn't about  old   the dirt   new   the cloud. It's about what is good. A combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at. You see it in all interesting art today  in all interesting businesses today. How we combine those two together to make good is very interesting. So art makes questions  and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions. We aren't functioning so easily anymore. We aren't a simple authoritarian regime anymore. As an example of authoritarianism  I was in Russia one time traveling in St. Petersburg  at a national monument  and I saw this sign that says   Do Not Walk On The Grass   and I thought  oh  I mean  I speak English  and you're trying to single me out. That's not fair. But I found a sign for Russian speaking people  and it was the best sign ever to say no. It was like   No swimming  no hiking  no anything.  My favorite ones are  no plants.  Why would you bring a plant to a national monument  I'm not sure. And also  no love.   Laughter  So that is authoritarianism. And what is that  structurally  It's a hierarchy. We all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today  but as we know  it's been disrupted. It is now a network instead of a perfect tree. It's a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy. And that's kind of awkward. And so today  leaders are faced with how to lead differently  I believe. This is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont on creative leadership. What can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead  Because in many senses  a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes. Someone who's creative actually loves to learn from mistakes. A traditional leader is always wanting to be right  whereas a creative leader hopes to be right. And this frame is important today  in this complex  ambiguous space  and artists and designers have a lot to teach us  I believe. And I had a show in London recently where my friends invited me to come to London for four days to sit in a sandbox  and I said great. And so I sat in a sandbox for four days straight  six hours every day  six minute appointments with anyone in London  and that was really bad. But I would listen to people  hear their issues  draw in the sand  try to figure things out  and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing. You know  It's all these one on one meetings for like four days. And it felt kind of like being president  actually. I was like   Oh  this my job. President. I do a lot of meetings  you know   And by the end of the experience  I realized why I was doing this. It's because leaders  what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen  and in that room I found so many connections between people across all of London  and so leadership  connecting people  is the great question today. Whether you're in the hierarchy or the heterarchy  it's a wonderful design challenge. And one thing I've been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective. Let me show you something I haven't shown anywhere  actually. So what this is  is a kind of a sketch  an application sketch I wrote in Python. You know how there's Photoshop  This is called Powershop  and the way it works is imagine an organization. You know  the CEO isn't ever at the top. The CEO's at the center of the organization. There may be different subdivisions in the organization  and you might want to look into different areas. For instance  green are areas doing well  red are areas doing poorly. You know  how do you  as the leader  scan  connect  make things happen  So for instance  you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there  and know that you know someone in Eco  over here  and these people here are in Eco  the people you might engage with as CEO  people going across the hierarchy. And part of the challenge of the CEO is to find connections across areas  and so you might look in R D  and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest  and it's a person important to engage. So you might want to  for instance  get a heads up display on how you're interacting with them. How many coffees do you have  How often are you calling them  emailing them  What is the tenor of their email  How is it working out  Leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy. You can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso  the guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis. What is the tenor of your communications  So these kind of systems  I believe  are important. They're targeted social media systems around leaders. And I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design  because art and design lets you think like this  find different systems like this  and I've just begun thinking like this  so I'm glad to share that with you. So in closing  I want to thank all of you for your attention. Thanks very much.  Applause  One in four people suffer from some sort of mental illness  so if it was one  two  three  four  it's you  sir. You. Yeah.  Laughter  With the weird teeth. And you next to him.  Laughter  You know who you are. Actually  that whole row isn't right.  Laughter  That's not good. Hi. Yeah. Real bad. Don't even look at me.  Laughter  I am one of the one in four. Thank you. I think I inherit it from my mother  who  used to crawl around the house on all fours. She had two sponges in her hand  and then she had two tied to her knees. My mother was completely absorbent.  Laughter  And she would crawl around behind me going   Who brings footprints into a building    So that was kind of a clue that things weren't right. So before I start  I would like to thank the makers of Lamotrigine  Sertraline  and Reboxetine  because without those few simple chemicals  I would not be vertical today. So how did it start  My mental illness    well  I'm not even going to talk about my mental illness. What am I going to talk about  Okay. I always dreamt that  when I had my final breakdown  it would be because I had a deep Kafkaesque existentialist revelation  or that maybe Cate Blanchett would play me and she would win an Oscar for it.  Laughter  But that's not what happened. I had my breakdown during my daughter's sports day. There were all the parents sitting in a parking lot eating food out of the back of their car    only the English    eating their sausages. They loved their sausages.  Laughter  Lord and Lady Rigor Mortis were nibbling on the tarmac  and then the gun went off and all the girlies started running  and all the mummies went   Run  Run Chlamydia  Run    Laughter   Run like the wind  Veruca  Run   And all the girlies  girlies running  running  running  everybody except for my daughter  who was just standing at the starting line  just waving  because she didn't know she was supposed to run. So I took to my bed for about a month  and when I woke up I found I was institutionalized  and when I saw the other inmates  I realized that I had found my people  my tribe.  Laughter  Because they became my only friends  they became my friends  because very few people that I knew    Well  I wasn't sent a lot of cards or flowers. I mean  if I had had a broken leg or I was with child I would have been inundated  but all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up. Perk up. Because I didn't think of that.  Laughter  Because  you know  the one thing  one thing that you get with this disease  this one comes with a package  is you get a real sense of shame  because your friends go   Oh come on  show me the lump  show me the x rays   and of course you've got nothing to show  so you're  like  really disgusted with yourself because you're thinking   I'm not being carpet bombed. I don't live in a township.  So you start to hear these abusive voices  but you don't hear one abusive voice  you hear about a thousand            abusive voices  like if the Devil had Tourette's  that's what it would sound like. But we all know in here  you know  there is no Devil  there are no voices in your head. You know that when you have those abusive voices  all those little neurons get together and in that little gap you get a real toxic  I want to kill myself  kind of chemical  and if you have that over and over again on a loop tape  you might have yourself depression. Oh  and that's not even the tip of the iceberg. If you get a little baby  and you abuse it verbally  its little brain sends out chemicals that are so destructive that the little part of its brain that can tell good from bad just doesn't grow  so you might have yourself a homegrown psychotic. If a soldier sees his friend blown up  his brain goes into such high alarm that he can't actually put the experience into words  so he just feels the horror over and over again. So here's my question. My question is  how come when people have mental damage  it's always an active imagination  How come every other organ in your body can get sick and you get sympathy  except the brain  I'd like to talk a little bit more about the brain  because I know you like that here at TED  so if you just give me a minute here  okay. Okay  let me just say  there's some good news. There is some good news. First of all  let me say  we've come a long  long way. We started off as a teeny  teeny little one celled amoeba  tiny  just sticking onto a rock  and now  voila  the brain. Here we go.  Laughter  This little baby has a lot of horsepower. It comes completely conscious. It's got state of the art lobes. We've got the occipital lobe so we can actually see the world. We got the temporal lobe so we can actually hear the world. Here we've got a little bit of long term memory  so  you know that night you want to forget  when you got really drunk  Bye bye  Gone.  Laughter  So actually  it's filled with     billion neurons just zizzing away  electrically transmitting information  zizzing  zizzing. I'm going to give you a little side view here. I don't know if you can get that here.  Laughter  So  zizzing away  and so    Laughter    And for every one   I know  I drew this myself. Thank you. For every one single neuron  you can actually have from        to         different connections or dendrites or whatever you want to call it  and every time you learn something  or you have an experience  that bush grows  you know  that bush of information. Can you imagine  every human being is carrying that equipment  even Paris Hilton   Laughter  Go figure. But I got a little bad news for you folks. I got some bad news. This isn't for the one in four. This is for the four in four. We are not equipped for the   st century. Evolution did not prepare us for this. We just don't have the bandwidth  and for people who say  oh  they're having a nice day  they're perfectly fine  they're more insane than the rest of us. Because I'll show you where there might be a few glitches in evolution. Okay  let me just explain this to you. When we were ancient man    Laughter    millions of years ago  and we suddenly felt threatened by a predator  okay     Laughter    we would   Thank you. I drew these myself.  Laughter  Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause  Thank you. Anyway  we would fill up with our own adrenaline and our own cortisol  and then we'd kill or be killed  we'd eat or we'd be eaten  and then suddenly we'd de fuel  and we'd go back to normal. Okay. So the problem is  nowadays  with modern man   Laughter    when we feel in danger  we still fill up with our own chemical but because we can't kill traffic wardens    Laughter    or eat estate agents  the fuel just stays in our body over and over  so we're in a constant state of alarm  a constant state. And here's another thing that happened. About         years ago  when language came online  we started to put words to this constant emergency  so it wasn't just   Oh my God  there's a saber toothed tiger   which could be  it was suddenly   Oh my God  I didn't send the email. Oh my God  my thighs are too fat. Oh my God  everybody can see I'm stupid. I didn't get invited to the Christmas party   So you've got this nagging loop tape that goes over and over again that drives you insane  so  you see what the problem is  What once made you safe now drives you insane. I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news  but somebody has to be. Your pets are happier than you are.  Laughter  So kitty cat  meow  happy happy happy  human beings  screwed.  Laughter  Completely and utterly    so  screwed. But my point is  if we don't talk about this stuff  and we don't learn how to deal with our lives  it's not going to be one in four. It's going to be four in four who are really  really going to get ill in the upstairs department. And while we're at it  can we please stop the stigma  Thank you.  Applause  Five years ago  I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland. Penn State asked me  a communications teacher  to teach a communications class for engineering students. And I was scared.  Laughter  Really scared. Scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big  unfamiliar words. But as these conversations unfolded  I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world. That's just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students. I was amazed at the ideas that they had  and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well. And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication. We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world. Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges  from energy to environment to health care  among others  and if we don't know about it and understand it  then the work isn't done  and I believe it's our responsibility as non scientists to have these interactions. But these great conversations can't occur if our scientists and engineers don't invite us in to see their wonderland. So scientists and engineers  please  talk nerdy to us. I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging. First question to answer for us  so what  Tell us why your science is relevant to us. Don't just tell me that you study trabeculae  but tell me that you study trabeculae  which is the mesh like structure of our bones because it's important to understanding and treating osteoporosis. And when you're describing your science  beware of jargon. Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas. Sure  you can say  spatial and temporal   but why not just say  space and time   which is so much more accessible to us  And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down. Instead  as Einstein said  make everything as simple as possible  but no simpler. You can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas. A few things to consider are having examples  stories and analogies. Those are ways to engage and excite us about your content. And when presenting your work  drop the bullet points. Have you ever wondered why they're called bullet points   Laughter  What do bullets do  Bullets kill  and they will kill your presentation. A slide like this is not only boring  but it relies too much on the language area of our brain  and causes us to become overwhelmed. Instead  this example slide by Genevieve Brown is much more effective. It's showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower. And the trick here is to use a single  readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost  and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what's being described. So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering. And because the engineers that I've worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd  I want to summarize with an equation.  Laughter  Take your science  subtract your bullet points and your jargon  divide by relevance  meaning share what's relevant to the audience  and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you're doing  and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding. And so  scientists and engineers  when you've solved this equation  by all means  talk nerdy to me.  Laughter  Thank you.  Applause  In       I met in Florence a professor  Carlo Pedretti  my former professor of art history  and today a world renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci. Well  he asked me if I could find some technological way to unfold a five centuries old mystery related to a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci  the  Battle of Anghiari   which is supposed to be located in the Hall of the     in Palazzo Vecchio  in Florence. Well  in the mid '  s  there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me  especially in Italy  and so I decided  with some researchers from the United States and the University of Florence  to start probing the murals decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the     searching for the lost Leonardo. Unfortunately  at that time we did not know that that was not exactly where we should be looking  because we had to go much deeper in  and so the research came to a halt  and it was only taken up in      thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family. Well  this time  we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the Hall of the     was before the remodeling  and the so called Sala Grande  which was built in       and to find out the original doors  windows  and in order to do that  we first created a  D model  and then  with thermography  we went on to discover hidden windows. These are the original windows of the hall of the Sala Grande. We also found out about the height of the ceiling  and we managed to reconstruct  therefore  all the layout of this original hall the way it was before there came Vasari  and restructured the whole thing  including a staircase that was very important in order to precisely place  The Battle of Anghiari  on a specific area of one of the two walls. Well  we also learned that Vasari  who was commissioned to remodel the Hall of the     between      and      by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family  we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap. One that we  see  here  Masaccio  the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence  so we just said  well maybe  Visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo  since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci. And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap. And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall  an air gap  and that's where we believe  The Battle of Anghiari   or at least the part that we know has been painted  which is called  The Fight for the Standard   should be located. Well  from there  unfortunately  in       the project came to a halt. Many political reasons. So I decided to go back to my alma mater  and  at the University of California  San Diego  and I proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cultural heritage. And in       we created CISA  as a research center for cultural heritage  specifically art  architecture and archaeology. So students started to flow in  and we started to build technologies  because that's basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and do fieldwork. We came back in the Hall of the     in       and this time  with a great group of students  and my colleague  Professor Falko Kuester  who is now the director at CISA   and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left. Well  we were confined though  limited  I should rather say  for several reasons that it's not worth explaining  to endoscopy only  of the many other options we had  and with a  mm camera attached to it  we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be a reddish color  black color  and there is some beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams  XRF  X ray diffraction  and the results are very positive so far. It seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments  and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before Vasari came in about    years later  well  those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to Leonardo. Well  we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind. As a matter of fact  this is by far the most important commission that Leonardo has ever had  and for doing this great masterpiece  he was named the number one artist influence at the time. I had also had the privilege since the last    years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me  but basically to do what  Well  to assess  for example  the state of conservation. See here the face of the Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it you suddenly see another  different lady  aged lady  I should rather say. There is a lot of varnish still sitting there  several retouches  and some over cleaning. It becomes very visible. But also  technology has helped to write new pages of our history  or at least to update pages of our histories. For example  the  Lady with the Unicorn   another painting by Rafael  well  you see the unicorn. A lot has been said and written about the unicorn  but if you take an X ray of the unicorn  it becomes a puppy dog. And    Laughter    no problem  but  unfortunately  continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn  did not paint the puppy dog  actually left the painting unfinished  so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn    Laughter    unfortunately  is not very reliable.  Laughter  Well  also  authenticity. Just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art. There would be a cultural revolution to say the least  but also  I would say  a market revolution  let me add. Take this example  Otto Marseus  nice painting  which is  Still Life  at the Pitti Gallery  and just have an infrared camera peering through  and luckily for art historians  it just was confirmed that there is a signature of Otto Marseus. It even says when it was made and also the location. So that was a good result. Sometimes  it's not that good  and so  again  authenticity and science could go together and change the way  not attributions being made  but at least lay the ground for a more objective  or  I should rather say  less subjective attribution  as it is done today. But I would say the discovery that really caught my imagination  my admiration  is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer  brown layer  of  The Adoration of the Magi.  Here you see a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it  and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath. Well  this happens to be the most important painting we have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci  and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries. Look at these portraits. They're magnificent. You see Leonardo at work. You see the geniality of his creation  right directly on the ground layer of the panel  and see this cool thing  finding  I should rather say  an elephant.  Laughter  Because of this elephant  over    new images came out  never seen for centuries. This was an epiphany. We came to understand and to prove that the brown coating that we see today was not done by Leonardo da Vinci  which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see  so thanks only to technology. Well  the tablet. Well  we thought  well  if we all have this pleasure  this privilege to see all this  to find all these discoveries  what about for everybody else  So we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet. Let me show you just simulating what we could be doing  any of us could be doing  in a museum environment. So let's say that we go to a museum with a tablet  okay  And we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see  like this. Okay  And I will just click on it  we pause  and now let me turn to you so the moment the image  or  I should say  the camera  has locked in the painting  then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded. And so  see. We can  as we said  we can zoom in. Then we can scroll. Okay  Let's go and find the elephant. So all we need is one finger. Just wipe off and we see the elephant.  Applause  Okay  And then if we want  we can continue the scroll to find out  for example  on the staircase  the whole iconography is going to be changed. There are a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple  and there are a lot of figures showing up. See  This is not just a curiosity  because it changes not just the iconography as you see it  but the iconology  the meaning of the painting  and we believe this is a cool way  easy way  that everybody could have access to  to become more the protagonist of your own discovery  and not just be so passive about it  as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums. Another concept is the digital clinical chart  which sounds very obvious if we were to talk about real patients  but when we talk about works of art  unfortunately  it's never been tapped as an idea. Well  we believe  again  that this should be the beginning  the very first step  to do real conservation  and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation  the technique  materials  and also if  when  and why we should restore  or  rather  to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting. Well  our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance  create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together. We definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values  these cultural values that we badly need  especially today. And if you want to summarize in one just single word  well  this is what we're trying to do. We're trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future. As long as we live a life of curiosity and passion  there is a bit of Leonardo in all of us. Thank you.  Applause  Over the past six months  I've spent my time traveling. I think I've done        miles  but without leaving my desk. And the reason I can do that is because I'm actually two people. I look like one person but I'm two people. I'm Eddie who is here  and at the same time  my alter ego is a big green boxy avatar nicknamed Cyber Frank. So that's what I spend my time doing. I'd like to start  if it's possible  with a test  because I do business stuff  so it's important that we focus on outcomes. And then I struggled  because I was thinking to myself   What should I talk  What should I do  It's a TED audience. It's got to be stretching. How am I going to make      So I just hope I've got the level of difficulty right. So let's just walk our way through this. Please could you work this through with me  You can shout out the answer if you like. The question is  which of these horizontal lines is longer  The answer is  Audience  The same.Eddie Obeng  The same. No  they're not the same.  Laughter  They're not the same. The top one is    percent longer than the bottom one. So why did you tell me they were the same  Do you remember when we were kids at school  about that big  they played the same trick on us  It was to teach us parallax. Do you remember  And you got  you said   It's the same   And you got it wrong. You remember  And you learned the answer  and you've carried this answer in your head for                years  The answer is the same. The answer is the same. So when you're asked what the lengths are  you say they're the same  but they're not the same  because I've changed it. And this is what I'm trying to explain has happened to us in the   st century. Somebody or something has changed the rules about how our world works. When I'm joking  I try and explain it happened at midnight  you see  while we were asleep  but it was midnight    years ago. Okay  You didn't notice it  But basically  what they do is  they switched all the rules round  so that the way to successfully run a business  an organization  or even a country  has been deleted  flipped  and it's a completely new   you think I'm joking  don't you   there's a completely new set of rules in operation.  Laughter  Did you notice that  I mean  you missed this one. You probably   No  you didn't. Okay.  Laughter  My simple idea is that what's happened is  the real   st century around us isn't so obvious to us  so instead we spend our time responding rationally to a world which we understand and recognize  but which no longer exists. You don't believe me  do you  Okay.  Applause  So let me take you on a little journey of many of the things I don't understand. If you search Amazon for the word  creativity   you'll discover something like        books. If you go on Google and you look for  innovation   creativity   you get    million hits. If you add the word  consultants   it doubles to    million.  Laughter  Are you with me  And yet  statistically  what you discover is that about one in         ideas is found making money or delivering benefits two years after its inception. It makes no sense. Companies make their expensive executives spend ages carefully preparing forecasts and budgets which are obsolete or need changing before they can be published. How is that possible  If you look at the visions we have  the visions of how we're going to change the world  the key thing is implementation. We have the vision. We've got to make it happen. We've spent decades professionalizing implementation. People are supposed to be good at making stuff happen. However  if I use as an example a family of five going on holiday  if you can imagine this  all the way from London all the way across to Hong Kong  what I want you to think about is their budget is only       pounds of expenses. What actually happens is  if I compare this to the average real project  average real successful project  the family actually end up in Makassar  South Sulawesi  at a cost of       pounds  whilst leaving two of the children behind.  Laughter  What I'm trying to explain to you is  there are things which don't make sense to us. It gets even worse than that. Let me just walk you through this one. This is a quote  and I'll just pick words out of it. It says    I'll put on the voice     In summary  your Majesty  the failure to foresee the timing  extent and severity of the crisis was due to the lack of creativity and the number of bright minds   or something like that. This was a group of eminent economists apologizing to the Queen of England when she asked the question   Why did no one tell us that the crisis was coming    Laughter  I'll never get my knighthood. I'll never get my knighthood.  Laughter  That's not the important point. The thing you have to remember is  these are eminent economists  some of the smartest people on the planet. Do you see the challenge   Laughter  It's scary. My friend and mentor  Tim Brown of IDEO  he explains that design must get big  and he's right. He wisely explains this to us. He says design thinking must tackle big systems for the challenges we have. He's absolutely right. And then I ask myself   Why was it ever small   Isn't it weird  You know  if collaboration is so cool  is cross functional working is so amazing  why did we build these huge hierarchies  What's going on  You see  I think what's happened  perhaps  is that we've not noticed that change I described earlier. What we do know is that the world has accelerated. Cyberspace moves everything at the speed of light. Technology accelerates things exponentially. So if this is now  and that's the past  and we start thinking about change  you know  all governments are seeking change  you're here seeking change  everybody's after change  it's really cool.  Laughter  So what happens is  we get this wonderful whooshing acceleration and change. The speed is accelerating. That's not the only thing. At the same time  as we've done that  we've done something really weird. We've doubled the population in    years  put half of them in cities  then connected them all up so they can interact. The density of the interaction of human beings is amazing. There are charts which show all these movements of information. That density of information is amazing. And then we've done a third thing. you know  for those of you who have as an office a little desk underneath the stairs  and you say  well this is my little desk under the stairs  no  You are sitting at the headquarters of a global corporation if you're connected to the Internet. What's happened is  we've changed the scale. Size and scale are no longer the same. And then add to that  every time you tweet  over a third of your followers follow from a country which is not your own. Global is the new scale. We know that. And so people say things like   The world is now a turbulent place.  Have you heard them saying things like that  And they use it as a metaphor. Have you come across this  And they think it's a metaphor  but this is not a metaphor. It's reality. As a young engineering student  I remember going to a demonstration where they basically  the demonstrator did something quite intriguing. What he did was  he got a transparent pipe   have you seen this demonstration before    he attached it to a tap. So effectively what you had was  you had a situation where   I'll try and draw the tap and the pipe  actually I'll skip the tap. The taps are hard. Okay  So I'll write the word  tap.  Is that okay  It's a tap.  Laughter  Okay  so he attaches it to a transparent pipe  and he turns the water on. And he says  do you notice anything  And the water is whooshing down this pipe. I mean  this is not exciting stuff. Are you with me  So the water goes up. He turns it back down. Great. And he says   Anything you notice   No. Then he sticks a needle into the pipe  and he connects this to a container  and he fills the container up with green ink. You with me  So guess what happens  A thin green line comes out as it flows down the pipe. It's not that interesting. And then he turns the water up a bit  so it starts coming back in. And nothing changes. So he's changing the flow of the water  but it's just a boring green line. He adds some more. He adds some more. And then something weird happens. There's this little flicker  and then as he turns it ever so slightly more  the whole of that green line disappears  and instead there are these little sort of inky dust devils close to the needle. They're called eddies. Not me. And they're violently dispersing the ink so that it actually gets diluted out  and the color's gone. What's happened in this world of pipe is somebody has flipped it. They've changed the rules from laminar to turbulent. All the rules are gone. In that environment  instantly  all the possibilities which turbulence brings are available  and it's not the same as laminar. And if we didn't have that green ink  you'd never notice. And I think this is our challenge  because somebody has actually increased   and it's probably you guys with all your tech and stuff   the speed  the scale and the density of interaction. Now how do we cope and deal with that  Well  we could just call it turbulence  or we could try and learn. Yes  learn  but I know you guys grew up in the days when there were actually these things called correct answers  because of the answer you gave me to the horizontal line puzzle  and you believe it will last forever. So I'll put a little line up here which represents learning  and that's how we used to do it. We could see things  understand them  take the time to put them into practice. Out here is the world. Now  what's happened to our pace of learning as the world has accelerated  Well  if you work for a corporation  you'll discover it's quite difficult to work on stuff which your boss doesn't approve of  isn't in the strategy  and anyway  you've got to go through your monthly meetings. If you work in an institution  one day you will get them to make that decision. And if you work in a market where people believe in cycles  it's even funnier  because you have to wait all the way for the cycle to fail before you go   There's something wrong.  You with me  So it's likely that the line  in terms of learning  is pretty flat. You with me  This point over here  the point at which the lines cross over  the pace of change overtakes the pace of learning  and for me  that is what I was describing when I was telling you about midnight. So what does it do to us  Well  it completely transforms what we have to do  many mistakes we make. We solve last year's problems without thinking about the future. If you try and think about it  the things you're solving now  what problems are they going to bring in the future  If you haven't understood the world you're living in  it's almost impossible to be absolutely certain that what you're going to deliver fits. I'll give you an example  a quick one. Creativity and ideas  I mentioned that earlier. All the CEOs around me  my clients  they want innovation  so they seek innovation. They say to people   Take risks and be creative   But unfortunately the words get transformed as they travel through the air. Entering their ears  what they hear is   Do crazy things and then I'll fire you.  Why   Laughter  Because   Why  Because in the old world  okay  in the old world  over here  getting stuff wrong was unacceptable. If you got something wrong  you'd failed. How should you be treated  Well  harshly  because you could have asked somebody who had experience. So we learned the answer and we carried this in our heads for        years  are you with me  The answer is  don't do things which are different. And then suddenly we tell them to and it doesn't work. You see  in reality  there are two ways you can fail in our new world. One  you're doing something that you should follow a procedure to  and it's a very difficult thing  you're sloppy  you get it wrong. How should you be treated  You should probably be fired. On the other hand  you're doing something new  no one's ever done before  you get it completely wrong. How should you be treated  Well  free pizzas  You should be treated better than the people who succeed. It's called smart failure. Why  Because you can't put it on your C.V. So what I want to leave you  then  is with the explanation of why I actually traveled        miles from my desk. When I realized the power of this new world  I quit my safe teaching job  and set up a virtual business school  the first in the world  in order to teach people how to make this happen  and I used some of my learnings about some of the rules which I'd learned on myself. If you're interested  worldaftermidnight.com  you'll find out more  but I've applied them to myself for over a decade  and I'm still here  and I still have my house  and the most important thing is  I hope I've done enough to inject a little green ink into your lives  so that when you go away and you're making your next absolutely sensible and rational decision  you'll take some time to think   Hmm  I wonder whether this also makes sense in our new world after midnight.  Thank you very much. Thank you  thank you.  Applause  So I have bad news  I have good news  and I have a task. So the bad news is that we all get sick. I get sick. You get sick. And every one of us gets sick  and the question really is  how sick do we get  Is it something that kills us  Is it something that we survive  Is it something that we can treat  And we've gotten sick as long as we've been people. And so we've always looked for reasons to explain why we get sick. And for a long time  it was the gods  right  The gods are angry with me  or the gods are testing me  right  Or God  singular  more recently  is punishing me or judging me. And as long as we've looked for explanations  we've wound up with something that gets closer and closer to science  which is hypotheses as to why we get sick  and as long as we've had hypotheses about why we get sick  we've tried to treat it as well. So this is Avicenna. He wrote a book over a thousand years ago called  The Canon of Medicine   and the rules he laid out for testing medicines are actually really similar to the rules we have today  that the disease and the medicine must be the same strength  the medicine needs to be pure  and in the end we need to test it in people. And so if you put together these themes of a narrative or a hypothesis in human testing  right  you get some beautiful results  even when we didn't have very good technologies. This is a guy named Carlos Finlay. He had a hypothesis that was way outside the box for his time  in the late     s. He thought yellow fever was not transmitted by dirty clothing. He thought it was transmitted by mosquitos. And they laughed at him. For    years  they called this guy  the mosquito man.  But he ran an experiment in people  right  He had this hypothesis  and he tested it in people. So he got volunteers to go move to Cuba and live in tents and be voluntarily infected with yellow fever. So some of the people in some of the tents had dirty clothes and some of the people were in tents that were full of mosquitos that had been exposed to yellow fever. And it definitively proved that it wasn't this magic dust called fomites in your clothes that caused yellow fever. But it wasn't until we tested it in people that we actually knew. And this is what those people signed up for. This is what it looked like to have yellow fever in Cuba at that time. You suffered in a tent  in the heat  alone  and you probably died. But people volunteered for this. And it's not just a cool example of a scientific design of experiment in theory. They also did this beautiful thing. They signed this document  and it's called an informed consent document. And informed consent is an idea that we should be very proud of as a society  right  It's something that separates us from the Nazis at Nuremberg  enforced medical experimentation. It's the idea that agreement to join a study without understanding isn't agreement. It's something that protects us from harm  from hucksters  from people that would try to hoodwink us into a clinical study that we don't understand  or that we don't agree to. And so you put together the thread of narrative hypothesis  experimentation in humans  and informed consent  and you get what we call clinical study  and it's how we do the vast majority of medical work. It doesn't really matter if you're in the north  the south  the east  the west. Clinical studies form the basis of how we investigate  so if we're going to look at a new drug  right  we test it in people  we draw blood  we do experiments  and we gain consent for that study  to make sure that we're not screwing people over as part of it. But the world is changing around the clinical study  which has been fairly well established for tens of years if not    to     years. So now we're able to gather data about our genomes  but  as we saw earlier  our genomes aren't dispositive. We're able to gather information about our environment. And more importantly  we're able to gather information about our choices  because it turns out that what we think of as our health is more like the interaction of our bodies  our genomes  our choices and our environment. And the clinical methods that we've got aren't very good at studying that because they are based on the idea of person to person interaction. You interact with your doctor and you get enrolled in the study. So this is my grandfather. I actually never met him  but he's holding my mom  and his genes are in me  right  His choices ran through to me. He was a smoker  like most people were. This is my son. So my grandfather's genes go all the way through to him  and my choices are going to affect his health. The technology between these two pictures cannot be more different  but the methodology for clinical studies has not radically changed over that time period. We just have better statistics. The way we gain informed consent was formed in large part after World War II  around the time that picture was taken. That was    years ago  and the way we gain informed consent  this tool that was created to protect us from harm  now creates silos. So the data that we collect for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's trials goes into silos where it can only be used for prostate cancer or for Alzheimer's research. Right  It can't be networked. It can't be integrated. It cannot be used by people who aren't credentialed. So a physicist can't get access to it without filing paperwork. A computer scientist can't get access to it without filing paperwork. Computer scientists aren't patient. They don't file paperwork. And this is an accident. These are tools that we created to protect us from harm  but what they're doing is protecting us from innovation now. And that wasn't the goal. It wasn't the point. Right  It's a side effect  if you will  of a power we created to take us for good. And so if you think about it  the depressing thing is that Facebook would never make a change to something as important as an advertising algorithm with a sample size as small as a Phase III clinical trial. We cannot take the information from past trials and put them together to form statistically significant samples. And that sucks  right  So    percent of men develop cancer. Thirty eight percent of women develop cancer. One in four men dies of cancer. One in five women dies of cancer  at least in the United States. And three out of the four drugs we give you if you get cancer fail. And this is personal to me. My sister is a cancer survivor. My mother in law is a cancer survivor. Cancer sucks. And when you have it  you don't have a lot of privacy in the hospital. You're naked the vast majority of the time. People you don't know come in and look at you and poke you and prod you  and when I tell cancer survivors that this tool we created to protect them is actually preventing their data from being used  especially when only three to four percent of people who have cancer ever even sign up for a clinical study  their reaction is not   Thank you  God  for protecting my privacy.  It's outrage that we have this information and we can't use it. And it's an accident. So the cost in blood and treasure of this is enormous. Two hundred and twenty six billion a year is spent on cancer in the United States. Fifteen hundred people a day die in the United States. And it's getting worse. So the good news is that some things have changed  and the most important thing that's changed is that we can now measure ourselves in ways that used to be the dominion of the health system. So a lot of people talk about it as digital exhaust. I like to think of it as the dust that runs along behind my kid. We can reach back and grab that dust  and we can learn a lot about health from it  so if our choices are part of our health  what we eat is a really important aspect of our health. So you can do something very simple and basic and take a picture of your food  and if enough people do that  we can learn a lot about how our food affects our health. One interesting thing that came out of this   this is an app for iPhones called The Eatery   is that we think our pizza is significantly healthier than other people's pizza is. Okay   Laughter  And it seems like a trivial result  but this is the sort of research that used to take the health system years and hundreds of thousands of dollars to accomplish. It was done in five months by a startup company of a couple of people. I don't have any financial interest in it. But more nontrivially  we can get our genotypes done  and although our genotypes aren't dispositive  they give us clues. So I could show you mine. It's just A's  T's  C's and G's. This is the interpretation of it. As you can see  I carry a    percent risk of prostate cancer     percent risk of psoriasis and a    percent risk of Alzheimer's disease. So that means  if you're a geneticist  you're freaking out  going   Oh my God  you told everyone you carry the ApoE E  allele. What's wrong with you   Right  When I got these results  I started talking to doctors  and they told me not to tell anyone  and my reaction is   Is that going to help anyone cure me when I get the disease   And no one could tell me yes. And I live in a web world where  when you share things  beautiful stuff happens  not bad stuff. So I started putting this in my slide decks  and I got even more obnoxious  and I went to my doctor  and I said   I'd like to actually get my bloodwork. Please give me back my data.  So this is my most recent bloodwork. As you can see  I have high cholesterol. I have particularly high bad cholesterol  and I have some bad liver numbers  but those are because we had a dinner party with a lot of good wine the night before we ran the test.  Laughter  Right. But look at how non computable this information is. This is like the photograph of my granddad holding my mom from a data perspective  and I had to go into the system and get it out. So the thing that I'm proposing we do here is that we reach behind us and we grab the dust  that we reach into our bodies and we grab the genotype  and we reach into the medical system and we grab our records  and we use it to build something together  which is a commons. And there's been a lot of talk about commonses  right  here  there  everywhere  right. A commons is nothing more than a public good that we build out of private goods. We do it voluntarily  and we do it through standardized legal tools. We do it through standardized technologies. Right. That's all a commons is. It's something that we build together because we think it's important. And a commons of data is something that's really unique  because we make it from our own data. And although a lot of people like privacy as their methodology of control around data  and obsess around privacy  at least some of us really like to share as a form of control  and what's remarkable about digital commonses is you don't need a big percentage if your sample size is big enough to generate something massive and beautiful. So not that many programmers write free software  but we have the Apache web server. Not that many people who read Wikipedia edit  but it works. So as long as some people like to share as their form of control  we can build a commons  as long as we can get the information out. And in biology  the numbers are even better. So Vanderbilt ran a study asking people  we'd like to take your biosamples  your blood  and share them in a biobank  and only five percent of the people opted out. I'm from Tennessee. It's not the most science positive state in the United States of America.  Laughter  But only five percent of the people wanted out. So people like to share  if you give them the opportunity and the choice. And the reason that I got obsessed with this  besides the obvious family aspects  is that I spend a lot of time around mathematicians  and mathematicians are drawn to places where there's a lot of data because they can use it to tease signals out of noise. And those correlations that they can tease out  they're not necessarily causal agents  but math  in this day and age  is like a giant set of power tools that we're leaving on the floor  not plugged in in health  while we use hand saws. If we have a lot of shared genotypes  and a lot of shared outcomes  and a lot of shared lifestyle choices  and a lot of shared environmental information  we can start to tease out the correlations between subtle variations in people  the choices they make and the health that they create as a result of those choices  and there's open source infrastructure to do all of this. Sage Bionetworks is a nonprofit that's built a giant math system that's waiting for data  but there isn't any. So that's what I do. I've actually started what we think is the world's first fully digital  fully self contributed  unlimited in scope  global in participation  ethically approved clinical research study where you contribute the data. So if you reach behind yourself and you grab the dust  if you reach into your body and grab your genome  if you reach into the medical system and somehow extract your medical record  you can actually go through an online informed consent process    because the donation to the commons must be voluntary and it must be informed    and you can actually upload your information and have it syndicated to the mathematicians who will do this sort of big data research  and the goal is to get         in the first year and a million in the first five years so that we have a statistically significant cohort that you can use to take smaller sample sizes from traditional research and map it against  so that you can use it to tease out those subtle correlations between the variations that make us unique and the kinds of health that we need to move forward as a society. And I've spent a lot of time around other commons. I've been around the early web. I've been around the early creative commons world  and there's four things that all of these share  which is  they're all really simple. And so if you were to go to the website and enroll in this study  you're not going to see something complicated. But it's not simplistic. These things are weak intentionally  right  because you can always add power and control to a system  but it's very difficult to remove those things if you put them in at the beginning  and so being simple doesn't mean being simplistic  and being weak doesn't mean weakness. Those are strengths in the system. And open doesn't mean that there's no money. Closed systems  corporations  make a lot of money on the open web  and they're one of the reasons why the open web lives is that corporations have a vested interest in the openness of the system. And so all of these things are part of the clinical study that we've created  so you can actually come in  all you have to be is    years old  willing to sign a contract that says I'm not going to be a jerk  basically  and you're in. You can start analyzing the data. You do have to solve a CAPTCHA as well.  Laughter  And if you'd like to build corporate structures on top of it  that's okay too. That's all in the consent  so if you don't like those terms  you don't come in. It's very much the design principles of a commons that we're trying to bring to health data. And the other thing about these systems is that it only takes a small number of really unreasonable people working together to create them. It didn't take that many people to make Wikipedia Wikipedia  or to keep it Wikipedia. And we're not supposed to be unreasonable in health  and so I hate this word  patient.  I don't like being patient when systems are broken  and health care is broken. I'm not talking about the politics of health care  I'm talking about the way we scientifically approach health care. So I don't want to be patient. And the task I'm giving to you is to not be patient. So I'd like you to actually try  when you go home  to get your data. You'll be shocked and offended and  I would bet  outraged  at how hard it is to get it. But it's a challenge that I hope you'll take  and maybe you'll share it. Maybe you won't. If you don't have anyone in your family who's sick  maybe you wouldn't be unreasonable. But if you do  or if you've been sick  then maybe you would. And we're going to be able to do an experiment in the next several months that lets us know exactly how many unreasonable people are out there. So this is the Athena Breast Health Network. It's a study of         women in California  and they're going to return all the data to the participants of the study in a computable form  with one clickability to load it into the study that I've put together. So we'll know exactly how many people are willing to be unreasonable. So what I'd end  with  is  the most beautiful thing I've learned since I quit my job almost a year ago to do this  is that it really doesn't take very many of us to achieve spectacular results. You just have to be willing to be unreasonable  and the risk we're running is not the risk those    men who got yellow fever ran. Right  It's to be naked  digitally  in public. So you know more about me and my health than I know about you. It's asymmetric now. And being naked and alone can be terrifying. But to be naked in a group  voluntarily  can be quite beautiful. And so it doesn't take all of us. It just takes all of some of us. Thank you. Beau Lotto  So  this game is very simple. All you have to do is read what you see. Right  So  I'm going to count to you  so we don't all do it together. Okay  one  two  three.Audience  Can you read this  BL  Amazing. What about this one  One  two  three.Audience  You are not reading this. BL  All right. One  two  three.  Laughter  If you were Portuguese  right  How about this one  One  two  three. Audience  What are you reading  BL  What are you reading  There are no words there. I said  read what you're seeing. Right  It literally says   Wat ar ou rea in    Laughter  Right  That's what you should have said. Right  Why is this  It's because perception is grounded in our experience. Right  The brain takes meaningless information and makes meaning out of it  which means we never see what's there  we never see information  we only ever see what was useful to see in the past. All right  Which means  when it comes to perception  we're all like this frog. Right  It's getting information. It's generating behavior that's useful.  Laughter  BL  And sometimes  when things don't go our way  we get a little bit annoyed  right  But we're talking about perception here  right  And perception underpins everything we think  we know  we believe  our hopes  our dreams  the clothes we wear  falling in love  everything begins with perception. Now if perception is grounded in our history  it means we're only ever responding according to what we've done before. But actually  it's a tremendous problem  because how can we ever see differently  Now  I want to tell you a story about seeing differently  and all new perceptions begin in the same way. They begin with a question. The problem with questions is they create uncertainty. Now  uncertainty is a very bad thing. It's evolutionarily a bad thing. If you're not sure that's a predator  it's too late. Okay   Laughter  Even seasickness is a consequence of uncertainty. Right  If you go down below on a boat  your inner ears are you telling you you're moving. Your eyes  because it's moving in register with the boat  say I'm standing still. Your brain cannot deal with the uncertainty of that information  and it gets ill. The question  why   is one of the most dangerous things you can do  because it takes you into uncertainty. And yet  the irony is  the only way we can ever do anything new is to step into that space. So how can we ever do anything new  Well fortunately  evolution has given us an answer  right  And it enables us to address even the most difficult of questions. The best questions are the ones that create the most uncertainty. They're the ones that question the things we think to be true already. Right  It's easy to ask questions about how did life begin  or what extends beyond the universe  but to question what you think to be true already is really stepping into that space. So what is evolution's answer to the problem of uncertainty  It's play. Now play is not simply a process. Experts in play will tell you that actually it's a way of being. Play is one of the only human endeavors where uncertainty is actually celebrated. Uncertainty is what makes play fun. Right  It's adaptable to change. Right  It opens possibility  and it's cooperative. It's actually how we do our social bonding  and it's intrinsically motivated. What that means is that we play to play. Play is its own reward. Now if you look at these five ways of being  these are the exact same ways of being you need in order to be a good scientist. Science is not defined by the method section of a paper. It's actually a way of being  which is here  and this is true for anything that is creative. So if you add rules to play  you have a game. That's actually what an experiment is. So armed with these two ideas  that science is a way of being and experiments are play  we asked  can anyone become a scientist  And who better to ask than    eight  to    year old children  Because they're experts in play. So I took my bee arena down to a small school in Devon  and the aim of this was to not just get the kids to see science differently  but  through the process of science  to see themselves differently. Right  The first step was to ask a question. Now  I should say that we didn't get funding for this study because the scientists said small children couldn't make a useful contribution to science  and the teachers said kids couldn't do it. So we did it anyway. Right  Of course. So  here are some of the questions. I put them in small print so you wouldn't bother reading it. Point is that five of the questions that the kids came up with were actually the basis of science publication the last five to    years. Right  So they were asking questions that were significant to expert scientists. Now here  I want to share the stage with someone quite special. Right  She was one of the young people who was involved in this study  and she's now one of the youngest published scientists in the world. Right  She will now  once she comes onto stage  will be the youngest person to ever speak at TED. Right  Now  science and asking questions is about courage. Now she is the personification of courage  because she's going to stand up here and talk to you all. So Amy  would you please come up   Applause  So Amy's going to help me tell the story of what we call the Blackawton Bees Project  and first she's going to tell you the question that they came up with. So go ahead  Amy. Amy O'Toole  Thank you  Beau. We thought that it was easy to see the link between humans and apes in the way that we think  because we look alike. But we wondered if there's a possible link with other animals. It'd be amazing if humans and bees thought similar  since they seem so different from us. So we asked if humans and bees might solve complex problems in the same way. Really  we wanted to know if bees can also adapt themselves to new situations using previously learned rules and conditions. So what if bees can think like us  Well  it'd be amazing  since we're talking about an insect with only one million brain cells. But it actually makes a lot of sense they should  because bees  like us  can recognize a good flower regardless of the time of day  the light  the weather  or from any angle they approach it from.  Applause  BL  So the next step was to design an experiment  which is a game. So the kids went off and they designed this experiment  and so    well  game    and so  Amy  can you tell us what the game was  and the puzzle that you set the bees  AO  The puzzle we came up with was an if then rule. We asked the bees to learn not just to go to a certain color  but to a certain color flower only when it's in a certain pattern. They were only rewarded if they went to the yellow flowers if the yellow flowers were surrounded by the blue  or if the blue flowers were surrounded by the yellow. Now there's a number of different rules the bees can learn to solve this puzzle. The interesting question is  which  What was really exciting about this project was we  and Beau  had no idea whether it would work. It was completely new  and no one had done it before  including adults.  Laughter  BL  Including the teachers  and that was really hard for the teachers. It's easy for a scientist to go in and not have a clue what he's doing  because that's what we do in the lab  but for a teacher not to know what's going to happen at the end of the day    so much of the credit goes to Dave Strudwick  who was the collaborator on this project. Okay  So I'm not going to go through the whole details of the study because actually you can read about it  but the next step is observation. So here are some of the students doing the observations. They're recording the data of where the bees fly. Dave Strudwick  Is she still going up here Student  Yeah. Dave Strudwick  So you keep track of each.Student  Henry  can you help me here  BL   Can you help me  Henry   What good scientist says that  right  Student  There's two up there. And three in here. BL  Right  So we've got our observations. We've got our data. They do the simple mathematics  averaging  etc.  etc. And now we want to share. That's the next step. So we're going to write this up and try to submit this for publication. Right  So we have to write it up. So we go  of course  to the pub. All right   Laughter  The one on the left is mine  okay   Laughter  Now  I tell them  a paper has four different sections  an introduction  a methods  a results  a discussion. The introduction says  what's the question and why  Methods  what did you do  Results  what was the observation  And the discussion is  who cares  Right  That's a science paper  basically.  Laughter  So the kids give me the words  right  I put it into a narrative  which means that this paper is written in kidspeak. It's not written by me. It's written by Amy and the other students in the class. As a consequence  this science paper begins   Once upon a time ...    Laughter  The results section  it says   Training phase  the puzzle ... duh duh duuuuuhhh.  Right   Laughter  And the methods  it says   Then we put the bees into the fridge  and made bee pie    smiley face. Right   Laughter  This is a science paper. We're going to try to get it published. So here's the title page. We have a number of authors there. All the ones in bold are eight to    years old. The first author is Blackawton Primary School  because if it were ever referenced  it would be  Blackawton et al   and not one individual. So we submit it to a public access journal  and it says this. It said many things  but it said this.  I'm afraid the paper fails our initial quality control checks in several different ways.   Laughter  In other words  it starts off  once upon a time   the figures are in crayon  etc.  Laughter  So we said  we'll get it reviewed. So I sent it to Dale Purves  who is at the National Academy of Science  one of the leading neuroscientists in the world  and he says   This is the most original science paper I have ever read     Laughter     and it certainly deserves wide exposure.  Larry Maloney  expert in vision  says   The paper is magnificent. The work would be publishable if done by adults.  So what did we do  We send it back to the editor. They say no. So we asked Larry and Natalie Hempel to write a commentary situating the findings for scientists  right  putting in the references  and we submit it to Biology Letters. And there  it was reviewed by five independent referees  and it was published. Okay   Applause  It took four months to do the science  two years to get it published.  Laughter  Typical science  actually  right  So this makes Amy and her friends the youngest published scientists in the world. What was the feedback like  Well  it was published two days before Christmas  downloaded        times in the first day  right  It was the Editors' Choice in Science  which is a top science magazine. It's forever freely accessible by Biology Letters. It's the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal. Last year  it was the second most downloaded paper by Biology Letters  and the feedback from not just scientists and teachers but the public as well. And I'll just read one.  I have read 'Blackawton Bees' recently. I don't have words to explain exactly how I am feeling right now. What you guys have done is real  true and amazing. Curiosity  interest  innocence and zeal are the most basic and most important things to do science. Who else can have these qualities more than children  Please congratulate your children's team from my side.  So I'd like to conclude with a physical metaphor. Can I do it on you   Laughter  Oh yeah  yeah  yeah  come on. Yeah yeah. Okay. Now  science is about taking risks  so this is an incredible risk  right   Laughter  For me  not for him. Right  Because we've only done this once before.  Laughter  And you like technology  right  Shimon Schocken  Right  but I like myself. BL  This is the epitome of technology. Right. Okay. Now ...  Laughter  Okay.  Laughter  Now  we're going to do a little demonstration  right  You have to close your eyes  and you have to point where you hear me clapping. All right  Okay  how about if everyone over there shouts. One  two  three  Audience   Shouts  Brilliant. Now  open your eyes. We'll do it one more time. Everyone over there shout.  Shouts  Where's the sound coming from   Laughter   Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  What's the point  The point is what science does for us. Right  We normally walk through life responding  but if we ever want to do anything different  we have to step into uncertainty. When he opened his eyes  he was able to see the world in a new way. That's what science offers us. It offers the possibility to step on uncertainty through the process of play  right  Now  true science education I think should be about giving people a voice and enabling to express that voice  so I've asked Amy to be the last voice in this short story. So  Amy  AO  This project was really exciting for me  because it brought the process of discovery to life  and it showed me that anyone  and I mean anyone  has the potential to discover something new  and that a small question can lead into a big discovery. Changing the way a person thinks about something can be easy or hard. It all depends on the way the person feels about change. But changing the way I thought about science was surprisingly easy. Once we played the games and then started to think about the puzzle  I then realized that science isn't just a boring subject  and that anyone can discover something new. You just need an opportunity. My opportunity came in the form of Beau  and the Blackawton Bee Project. Thank you.BL  Thank you very much.  Applause  Once upon a time  the world was a big  dysfunctional family. It was run by the great and powerful parents  and the people were helpless and hopeless naughty children. If any of the more rowdier children questioned the authority of the parents  they were scolded. If they went exploring into the parents' rooms  or even into the secret filing cabinets  they were punished  and told that for their own good they must never go in there again. Then one day  a man came to town with boxes and boxes of secret documents stolen from the parents' rooms.  Look what they've been hiding from you   he said. The children looked and were amazed. There were maps and minutes from meetings where the parents were slagging each other off. They behaved just like the children. And they made mistakes  too  just like the children. The only difference was  their mistakes were in the secret filing cabinets. Well  there was a girl in the town  and she didn't think they should be in the secret filing cabinets  or if they were  there ought to be a law to allow the children access. And so she set about to make it so. Well  I'm the girl in that story  and the secret documents that I was interested in were located in this building  the British Parliament  and the data that I wanted to get my hands on were the expense receipts of members of Parliament. I thought this was a basic question to ask in a democracy.  Applause  It wasn't like I was asking for the code to a nuclear bunker  or anything like that  but the amount of resistance I got from this Freedom of Information request  you would have thought I'd asked something like this. So I fought for about five years doing this  and it was one of many hundreds of requests that I made  not    I didn't    Hey  look  I didn't set out  honestly  to revolutionize the British Parliament. That was not my intention. I was just making these requests as part of research for my first book. But it ended up in this very long  protracted legal battle and there I was after five years fighting against Parliament in front of three of Britain's most eminent High Court judges waiting for their ruling about whether or not Parliament had to release this data. And I've got to tell you  I wasn't that hopeful  because I'd seen the establishment. I thought  it always sticks together. I am out of luck. Well  guess what  I won. Hooray.  Applause  Well  that's not exactly the story  because the problem was that Parliament delayed and delayed releasing that data  and then they tried to retrospectively change the law so that it would no longer apply to them. The transparency law they'd passed earlier that applied to everybody else  they tried to keep it so it didn't apply to them. What they hadn't counted on was digitization  because that meant that all those paper receipts had been scanned in electronically  and it was very easy for somebody to just copy that entire database  put it on a disk  and then just saunter outside of Parliament  which they did  and then they shopped that disk to the highest bidder  which was the Daily Telegraph  and then  you all remember  there was weeks and weeks of revelations  everything from porn movies and bath plugs and new kitchens and mortgages that had never been paid off. The end result was six ministers resigned  the first speaker of the house in     years was forced to resign  a new government was elected on a mandate of transparency      MPs stepped down at that election  and so far  four MPs and two lords have done jail time for fraud. So  thank you.  Applause  Well  I tell you that story because it wasn't unique to Britain. It was an example of a culture clash that's happening all over the world between bewigged and bestockinged officials who think that they can rule over us without very much prying from the public  and then suddenly confronted with a public who is no longer content with that arrangement  and not only not content with it  now  more often  armed with official data itself. So we are moving to this democratization of information  and I've been in this field for quite a while. Slightly embarrassing admission  Even when I was a kid  I used to have these little spy books  and I would  like  see what everybody was doing in my neighborhood and log it down. I think that was a pretty good indication about my future career as an investigative journalist  and what I've seen from being in this access to information field for so long is that it used to be quite a niche interest  and it's gone mainstream. Everybody  increasingly  around the world  wants to know about what people in power are doing. They want a say in decisions that are made in their name and with their money. It's this democratization of information that I think is an information enlightenment  and it has many of the same principles of the first Enlightenment. It's about searching for the truth  not because somebody says it's true   because I say so.  No  it's about trying to find the truth based on what you can see and what can be tested. That  in the first Enlightenment  led to questions about the right of kings  the divine right of kings to rule over people  or that women should be subordinate to men  or that the Church was the official word of God. Obviously the Church weren't very happy about this  and they tried to suppress it  but what they hadn't counted on was technology  and then they had the printing press  which suddenly enabled these ideas to spread cheaply  far and fast  and people would come together in coffee houses  discuss the ideas  plot revolution. In our day  we have digitization. That strips all the physical mass out of information  so now it's almost zero cost to copy and share information. Our printing press is the Internet. Our coffee houses are social networks. We're moving to what I would think of as a fully connected system  and we have global decisions to make in this system  decisions about climate  about finance systems  about resources. And think about it    if we want to make an important decision about buying a house  we don't just go off. I mean  I don't know about you  but I want to see a lot of houses before I put that much money into it. And if we're thinking about a finance system  we need a lot of information to take in. It's just not possible for one person to take in the amount  the volume of information  and analyze it to make good decisions. So that's why we're seeing increasingly this demand for access to information. That's why we're starting to see more disclosure laws come out  so for example  on the environment  there's the Aarhus Convention  which is a European directive that gives people a very strong right to know  so if your water company is dumping water into your river  sewage water into your river  you have a right to know about it. In the finance industry  you now have more of a right to know about what's going on  so we have different anti bribery laws  money regulations  increased corporate disclosure  so you can now track assets across borders. And it's getting harder to hide assets  tax avoidance  pay inequality. So that's great. We're starting to find out more and more about these systems. And they're all moving to this central system  this fully connected system  all of them except one. Can you guess which one  It's the system which underpins all these other systems. It's the system by which we organize and exercise power  and there I'm talking about politics  because in politics  we're back to this system  this top down hierarchy. And how is it possible that the volume of information can be processed that needs to in this system  Well  it just can't. That's it. And I think this is largely what's behind the crisis of legitimacy in our different governments right now. So I've told you a bit about what I did to try and drag Parliament  kicking and screaming  into the   st century  and I'm just going to give you a couple of examples of what a few other people I know are doing. So this is a guy called Seb Bacon. He's a computer programmer  and he built a site called Alaveteli  and what it is  it's a Freedom of Information platform. It's open source  with documentation  and it allows you to make a Freedom of Information request  to ask your public body a question  so it takes all the hassle out of it  and I can tell you that there is a lot of hassle making these requests  so it takes all of that hassle out  and you just type in your question  for example  how many police officers have a criminal record  It zooms it off to the appropriate person  it tells you when the time limit is coming to an end  it keeps track of all the correspondence  it posts it up there  and it becomes an archive of public knowledge. So that's open source and it can be used in any country where there is some kind of Freedom of Information law. So there's a list there of the different countries that have it  and then there's a few more coming on board. So if any of you out there like the sound of that and have a law like that in your country  I know that Seb would love to hear from you about collaborating and getting that into your country. This is Birgitta J nsd ttir. She's an Icelandic MP. And quite an unusual MP. In Iceland  she was one of the protesters who was outside of Parliament when the country's economy collapsed  and then she was elected on a reform mandate  and she's now spearheading this project. It's the Icelandic Modern Media Initiative  and they've just got funding to make it an international modern media project  and this is taking all of the best laws around the world about freedom of expression  protection of whistleblowers  protection from libel  source protection  and trying to make Iceland a publishing haven. It's a place where your data can be free  so when we think about  increasingly  how governments want to access user data  what they're trying to do in Iceland is make this safe haven where it can happen. In my own field of investigative journalism  we're also having to start thinking globally  so this is a site called Investigative Dashboard. And if you're trying to track a dictator's assets  for example  Hosni Mubarak  you know  he's just funneling out cash from his country when he knows he's in trouble  and what you want to do to investigate that is  you need to have access to all of the world's  as many as you can  companies' house registrations databases. So this is a website that tries to agglomerate all of those databases into one place so you can start searching for  you know  his relatives  his friends  the head of his security services. You can try and find out how he's moving out assets from that country. But again  when it comes to the decisions which are impacting us the most  perhaps  the most important decisions that are being made about war and so forth  again we can't just make a Freedom of Information request. It's really difficult. So we're still having to rely on illegitimate ways of getting information  through leaks. So when the Guardian did this investigation about the Afghan War  you know  they can't walk into the Department of Defense and ask for all the information. You know  they're just not going to get it. So this came from leaks of tens of thousands of dispatches that were written by American soldiers about the Afghan War  and leaked  and then they're able to do this investigation. Another rather large investigation is around world diplomacy. Again  this is all based around leaks          U.S. diplomatic cables  and I was involved in this investigation because I got this leak through a leak from a disgruntled WikiLeaker and ended up going to work at the Guardian. So I can tell you firsthand what it was like to have access to this leak. It was amazing. I mean  it was amazing. It reminded me of that scene in  The Wizard of Oz.  Do you know the one I mean  Where the little dog Toto runs across to where the wizard  is   and he pulls back  the dog's pulling back the curtain  and     Don't look behind the screen. Don't look at the man behind the screen.  It was just like that  because what you started to see is that all of these grand statesmen  these very pompous politicians  they were just like us. They all bitched about each other. I mean  quite gossipy  those cables. Okay  but I thought it was a very important point for all of us to grasp  these are human beings just like us. They don't have special powers. They're not magic. They are not our parents. Beyond that  what I found most fascinating was the level of endemic corruption that I saw across all different countries  and particularly centered around the heart of power  around public officials who were embezzling the public's money for their own personal enrichment  and allowed to do that because of official secrecy. So I've mentioned WikiLeaks  because surely what could be more open than publishing all the material  Because that is what Julian Assange did. He wasn't content with the way the newspapers published it to be safe and legal. He threw it all out there. That did end up with vulnerable people in Afghanistan being exposed. It also meant that the Belarussian dictator was given a handy list of all the pro democracy campaigners in that country who had spoken to the U.S. government. Is that radical openness  I say it's not  because for me  what it means  it doesn't mean abdicating power  responsibility  accountability  it's actually being a partner with power. It's about sharing responsibility  sharing accountability. Also  the fact that he threatened to sue me because I got a leak of his leaks  I thought that showed a remarkable sort of inconsistency in ideology  to be honest  as well.  Laughs  The other thing is that power is incredibly seductive  and you must have two real qualities  I think  when you come to the table  when you're dealing with power  talking about power  because of its seductive capacity. You've got to have skepticism and humility. Skepticism  because you must always be challenging. I want to see why do you    you just say so  That's not good enough. I want to see the evidence behind why that's so. And humility because we are all human. We all make mistakes. And if you don't have skepticism and humility  then it's a really short journey to go from reformer to autocrat  and I think you only have to read  Animal Farm  to get that message about how power corrupts people. So what is the solution  It is  I believe  to embody within the rule of law rights to information. At the moment our rights are incredibly weak. In a lot of countries  we have Official Secrets Acts  including in Britain here. We have an Official Secrets Act with no public interest test. So that means it's a crime  people are punished  quite severely in a lot of cases  for publishing or giving away official information. Now wouldn't it be amazing  and really  this is what I want all of you to think about  if we had an Official Disclosure Act where officials were punished if they were found to have suppressed or hidden information that was in the public interest  So that    yes. Yes  My power pose.  Applause   Laughs  I would like us to work towards that. So it's not all bad news. I mean  there definitely is progress on the line  but I think what we find is that the closer that we get right into the heart of power  the more opaque  closed it becomes. So it was only just the other week that I heard London's Metropolitan Police Commissioner talking about why the police need access to all of our communications  spying on us without any judicial oversight  and he said it was a matter of life and death. He actually said that  it was a matter of life and death. There was no evidence. He presented no evidence of that. It was just   Because I say so. You have to trust me. Take it on faith.  Well  I'm sorry  people  but we are back to the pre Enlightenment Church  and we need to fight against that. So he was talking about the law in Britain which is the Communications Data Bill  an absolutely outrageous piece of legislation. In America  you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. You've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance. You have the National Security Agency building the world's giantest spy center. It's just this colossal    it's five times bigger than the U.S. Capitol  in which they're going to intercept and analyze communications  traffic and personal data to try and figure out who's the troublemaker in society. Well  to go back to our original story  the parents have panicked. They've locked all the doors. They've kidded out the house with CCTV cameras. They're watching all of us. They've dug a basement  and they've built a spy center to try and run algorithms and figure out which ones of us are troublesome  and if any of us complain about that  we're arrested for terrorism. Well  is that a fairy tale or a living nightmare  Some fairy tales have happy endings. Some don't. I think we've all read the Grimms' fairy tales  which are  indeed  very grim. But the world isn't a fairy tale  and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge. Equally  it could be better than we've been led to believe  but either way  we have to start seeing it exactly as it is  with all of its problems  because it's only by seeing it with all of its problems that we'll be able to fix them and live in a world in which we can all be happily ever after.  Laughs  Thank you very much. Thank you.  Applause  To understand the world that live in  we tell stories. And while remixing and sharing have come to define the web as we know it  all of us can now be part of that story through simple tools that allow us to make things online. But video has been left out. It arrived on the web in a small box  and there it has remained  completely disconnected from the data and the content all around it. In fact  in over a decade on the web  the only thing that has changed about video is the size of the box and the quality of the picture. Popcorn changes all of that. It's an online tool that allows anyone to combine video with content pulled live directly from the web. Videos created with Popcorn behave like the web itself  dynamic  full of links  and completely remixable  and finally allowed to break free from the frame. I want to give you a demo of a prototype that we're working on that we'll launch later this fall. It will be completely free  and it will work in any browser. So  every Popcorn production begins with the video  and so I've made a short     second clip using a newscaster template that we use in workshops. So let's watch it. We'll go back  and I'll show you how we made it. Hi  and welcome to my newscast. I've added my location with a Google Map  and it's live  so try moving it around. You can add pop ups with live links and custom icons  or pull in content from any web service  like Flickr  or add articles and blog posts with links out to the full content. So let's go back  and I'll show you what you saw. There was a lot there. So this is the timeline  and if you've ever edited video  you're familiar with this  but instead of clips in the timeline  what you're looking at is web events pulled into the video. Now in this Popcorn production we've got the title card  we've got a Google Map that shows up picture in picture  then Popcorn lets it push outside the frame and take over the whole screen. There are two pop ups bringing you some other information  and a final article with a link out to the original article. Let's go to this Google Map  and I'll show you how you can edit it. All you do  go into the timeline  double click the item  and I've set it to Toronto  because that's where I'm from. Let's set it to something else. Popcorn immediately goes out onto the web  talks to Google  grabs the map  and puts it in the display. And it's exactly the same for the people who watch your production. And it's live. It's not an image. So you click on it  you zoom in  right down to street view if you want to. Now in the video  I mentioned adding a live feed  which we can do right now  so let's add a live feed from Flickr. Go over to the right hand side  grab Flickr from the list of options  drag it into the timeline  and put it where you'd like it to go  and it immediately goes out to Flickr and starts pulling in images based on the tags. Now  my developers really like ponies  and so they've set that as the default tag. Let's try something else  maybe something a bit more relevant to today. Now here are live images being pulled straight from the feed. If you come and watch this a week from now  this will be completely different  dynamic  just like the web  and just like the web  everything is sourced  so click your link  and you go straight to Flickr and see the source image. Everything you've seen today is built with the basic building blocks of the web  HTML  CSS and JavaScript. That means it's completely remixable. It also means there's no proprietary software. All you need is a web browser. So imagine if every video that we watched on the web worked like the web  completely remixable  linked to its source content  and interactive for everyone who views it. I think Popcorn could change the way that we tell stories on the web  and the way we understand the world we live in. Thank you.  Applause  I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are  how globalized we aren't  and why it's important to actually be accurate in making those kinds of assessments. And the leading point of view on this  whether measured by number of books sold  mentions in media  or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization  is this view that national borders really don't matter very much anymore  cross border integration is close to complete  and we live in one world. And what's interesting about this view is  again  it's a view that's held by pro globalizers like Tom Friedman  from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted  but it's also held by anti globalizers  who see this giant globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives if it hasn't already done so. The other thing I would add is that this is not a new view. I'm a little bit of an amateur historian  so I've spent some time going back  trying to see the first mention of this kind of thing. And the best  earliest quote that I could find was one from David Livingstone  writing in the     s about how the railroad  the steam ship  and the telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly with the rest of the world. Now clearly  David Livingstone was a little bit ahead of his time  but it does seem useful to ask ourselves   Just how global are we   before we think about where we go from here. So the best way I've found of trying to get people to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat  may not even be close to flat  is with some data. So one of the things I've been doing over the last few years is really compiling data on things that could either happen within national borders or across national borders  and I've looked at the cross border component as a percentage of the total. I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today  but let me just give you a few data points. I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow  one kind of flow of people  one kind of flow of capital  and  of course  trade in products and services. So let's start off with plain old telephone service. Of all the voice calling minutes in the world last year  what percentage do you think were accounted for by cross border phone calls  Pick a percentage in your own mind. The answer turns out to be two percent. If you include Internet telephony  you might be able to push this number up to six or seven percent  but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate. Or let's turn to people moving across borders. One particular thing we might look at  in terms of long term flows of people  is what percentage of the world's population is accounted for by first generation immigrants  Again  please pick a percentage. Turns out to be a little bit higher. It's actually about three percent. Or think of investment. Take all the real investment that went on in the world in     . What percentage of that was accounted for by foreign direct investment  Not quite ten percent. And then finally  the one statistic that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen  the export to GDP ratio. If you look at the official statistics  they typically indicate a little bit above    percent. However  there's a big problem with the official statistics  in that if  for instance  a Japanese component supplier ships something to China to be put into an iPod  and then the iPod gets shipped to the U.S.  that component ends up getting counted multiple times. So nobody knows how bad this bias with the official statistics actually is  so I thought I would ask the person who's spearheading the effort to generate data on this  Pascal Lamy  the Director of the World Trade Organization  what his best guess would be of exports as a percentage of GDP  without the double  and triple counting  and it's actually probably a bit under    percent  rather than the    percent plus numbers that we're talking about. So it's very clear that if you look at these numbers or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book   World  .    that we're very  very far from the no border effect benchmark  which would imply internationalization levels of the order of            percent. So clearly  apocalyptically minded authors have overstated the case. But it's not just the apocalyptics  as I think of them  who are prone to this kind of overstatement. I've also spent some time surveying audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guess these numbers to be. Let me share with you the results of a survey that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run of its readership as to what people's guesses along these dimensions actually were. So a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide. First of all  there is a suggestion of some error. Okay.  Laughter  Second  these are pretty large errors. For four quantities whose average value is less than    percent  you have people guessing three  four times that level. Even though I'm an economist  I find that a pretty large error. And third  this is not just confined to the readers of the Harvard Business Review. I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts of the world  and in all cases except one  where a group actually underestimated the trade to GDP ratio  people have this tendency towards overestimation  and so I thought it important to give a name to this  and that's what I refer to as globaloney  the difference between the dark blue bars and the light gray bars. Especially because  I suspect  some of you may still be a little bit skeptical of the claims  I think it's important to just spend a little bit of time thinking about why we might be prone to globaloney. A couple of different reasons come to mind. First of all  there's a real dearth of data in the debate. Let me give you an example. When I first published some of these data a few years ago in a magazine called Foreign Policy  one of the people who wrote in  not entirely in agreement  was Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled  Why the World Isn't Flat   that wasn't too surprising.  Laughter  What was very surprising to me was Tom's critique  which was   Ghemawat's data are narrow.  And this caused me to scratch my head  because as I went back through his several hundred page book  I couldn't find a single figure  chart  table  reference or footnote. So my point is  I haven't presented a lot of data here to convince you that I'm right  but I would urge you to go away and look for your own data to try and actually assess whether some of these hand me down insights that we've been bombarded with actually are correct. So dearth of data in the debate is one reason. A second reason has to do with peer pressure. I remember  I decided to write my  Why the World Isn't Flat  article  because I was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai  and the interviewer's first question to me was   Professor Ghemawat  why do you still believe that the world is round   And I started laughing  because I hadn't come across that formulation before.  Laughter  And as I was laughing  I was thinking  I really need a more coherent response  especially on national TV. I'd better write something about this.  Laughter  But what I can't quite capture for you was the pity and disbelief with which the interviewer asked her question. The perspective was  here is this poor professor. He's clearly been in a cave for the last        years. He really has no idea as to what's actually going on in the world. So try this out with your friends and acquaintances  if you like. You'll find that it's very cool to talk about the world being one  etc. If you raise questions about that formulation  you really are considered a bit of an antique. And then the final reason  which I mention  especially to a TED audience  with some trepidation  has to do with what I call  techno trances.  If you listen to techno music for long periods of time  it does things to your brainwave activity.  Laughter  Something similar seems to happen with exaggerated conceptions of how technology is going to overpower in the very immediate run all cultural barriers  all political barriers  all geographic barriers  because at this point I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions  but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students  hands go up  and people ask me   Yeah  but what about Facebook   And I got this question often enough that I thought I'd better do some research on Facebook. Because  in some sense  it's the ideal kind of technology to think about. Theoretically  it makes it as easy to form friendships halfway around the world as opposed to right next door. What percentage of people's friends on Facebook are actually located in countries other than where people we're analyzing are based  The answer is probably somewhere between    to    percent. Non negligible  so we don't live in an entirely local or national world  but very  very far from the    percent level that you would expect  and the reason's very simple. We don't  or I hope we don't  form friendships at random on Facebook. The technology is overlaid on a pre existing matrix of relationships that we have  and those relationships are what the technology doesn't quite displace. Those relationships are why we get far fewer than    percent of our friends being located in countries other than where we are. So does all this matter  Or is globaloney just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention to globalization related issues  I want to suggest that actually  globaloney can be very harmful to your health. First of all  recognizing that the glass is only    to    percent full is critical to seeing that there might be potential for additional gains from additional integration  whereas if we thought we were already there  there would be no particular point to pushing harder. It's a little bit like  we wouldn't be having a conference on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about at this conference. So being accurate about how limited globalization levels are is critical to even being able to notice that there might be room for something more  something that would contribute further to global welfare. Which brings me to my second point. Avoiding overstatement is also very helpful because it reduces and in some cases even reverses some of the fears that people have about globalization. So I actually spend most of my  World  .   book working through a litany of market failures and fears that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate. I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today  so let me just present to you two headlines as an illustration of what I have in mind. Think of France and the current debate about immigration. When you ask people in France what percentage of the French population is immigrants  the answer is about    percent. That's their guess. Maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric that we see around the immigration issue. Or to take an even more striking example  when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations did a survey of Americans  asking them to guess what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid  the guess was    percent  which is slightly in excess of the actual level     actually about ...       Laughter    of U.S. governmental commitments to federal aid. The reassuring thing about this particular survey was  when it was pointed out to people how far their estimates were from the actual data  some of them   not all of them   seemed to become more willing to consider increases in foreign aid. So foreign aid is actually a great way of sort of wrapping up here  because if you think about it  what I've been talking about today is this notion    very uncontroversial amongst economists    that most things are very home biased.  Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people   is about the most home biased thing you can find. If you look at the OECD countries and how much they spend per domestic poor person  and compare it with how much they spend per poor person in poor countries  the ratio   Branko Milanovic at the World Bank did the calculations   turns out to be about        to one. Now of course  some of us  if we truly are cosmopolitan  would like to see that ratio being brought down to one is to one. I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are. If we simply brought that ratio down to        to one  we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed at the Rio Summit    years ago that the summit that ended last week made no further progress on. So in summary  while radical openness is great  given how closed we are  even incremental openness could make things dramatically better. Thank you very much.  Applause  In the   th century  a woman named Giulia Tofana had a very successful perfume business. For over    years she ran it. It sort of ended abruptly when she was executed    Laughter    for murdering     men. You see  it wasn't a very good perfume. In fact  it was completely odorless and tasteless and colorless  but as a poison  it was the best money could buy  so women flocked to her in order to murder their husbands. It turns out that poisoners were a valued and feared group  because poisoning a human being is a quite difficult thing. The reason is  we have sort of a built in poison detector. You can see this as early as even in newborn infants. If you are willing to do this  you can take a couple of drops of a bitter substance or a sour substance  and you'll see that face  the tongue stick out  the wrinkled nose  as if they're trying to get rid of what's in their mouth. This reaction expands into adulthood and becomes sort of a full blown disgust response  no longer just about whether or not we're about to be poisoned  but whenever there's a threat of physical contamination from some source. But the face remains strikingly similar. It has expanded more  though  than just keeping us away from physical contaminants  and there's a growing body of evidence to suggest that  in fact  this emotion of disgust now influences our moral beliefs and even our deeply held political intuitions. Why this might be the case  We can understand this process by understanding a little bit about emotions in general. So the basic human emotions  those kinds of emotions that we share with all other human beings  exist because they motivate us to do good things and they keep us away from doing bad things. So by and large  they are good for our survival. Take the emotion of fear  for instance. It keeps us away from doing things that are really  really risky. This photo taken just before his death    Laughter    is actually a   No  one reason this photo is interesting is because most people would not do this  and if they did  they would not live to tell it  because fear would have kicked in a long time ago to a natural predator. Just like fear offers us protective benefits  disgust seems to do the same thing  except for what disgust does is keeps us away from not things that might eat us  or heights  but rather things that might poison us  or give us disease and make us sick. So one of the features of disgust that makes it such an interesting emotion is that it's very  very easy to elicit  in fact more so than probably any of the other basic emotions  and so I'm going to show you that with a couple of images I can probably make you feel disgust. So turn away. I'll tell you when you can turn back. I mean  you see it every day  right  I mean  come on.  Laughter  Okay  turn back  if you didn't look. Those probably made a lot of you in the audience feel very  very disgusted  but if you didn't look  I can tell you about some of the other things that have been shown sort of across the world to make people disgusted  things like feces  urine  blood  rotten flesh. These are the sorts of things that it makes sense for us to stay away from  because they might actually contaminate us. In fact  just having a diseased appearance or odd sexual acts  these things are also things that give us a lot of disgust. Darwin was probably one of the first scientists to systematically investigate the human emotions  and he pointed to the universal nature and the strength of the disgust response. This is an anecdote from his travels in South America.  In Tierro del Fuego a native touched with his finger some cold preserved meat while I was eating ... and plainly showed disgust at its softness  whilst I felt utter disgust at my food being touched by a naked savage    Laughter    though his hands did not appear dirty.  He later wrote   It's okay  some of my best friends are naked savages.   Laughter  Well it turns out it's not only old timey British scientists who are this squeamish. I recently got a chance to talk to Richard Dawkins for a documentary  and I was able to disgust him a bunch of times. Here's my favorite. Richard Dawkins   We've evolved around courtship and sex  are attached to deep rooted emotions and reactions that are hard to jettison overnight.  David Pizarro  So my favorite part of this clip is that Professor Dawkins actually gagged. He jumps back  and he gags  and we had to do it three times  and all three times he gagged.  Laughter  And he was really gagging. I thought he might throw up on me  actually. One of the features  though  of disgust  is not just its universality and its strength  but the way that it works through association. So when one disgusting thing touches a clean thing  that clean thing becomes disgusting  not the other way around. This makes it very useful as a strategy if you want to convince somebody that an object or an individual or an entire social group is disgusting and should be avoided. The philosopher Martha Nussbaum points this out in this quote   Thus throughout history  certain disgust properties    sliminess  bad smell  stickiness  decay  foulness    have been repeatedly and monotonously been associated with ... Jews  women  homosexuals  untouchables  lower class people    all of those are imagined as tainted by the dirt of the body.  Let me give you just some examples of how  some powerful examples of how this has been used historically. This comes from a Nazi children's book published in        Just look at these guys  The louse infested beards  the filthy  protruding ears  those stained  fatty clothes... Jews often have an unpleasant sweetish odor. If you have a good nose  you can smell the Jews.  A more modern example comes from people who try to convince us that homosexuality is immoral. This is from an anti gay website  where they said gays are  worthy of death for their vile ... sex practices.  They're like  dogs eating their own vomit and sows wallowing in their own feces.  These are disgust properties that are trying to be directly linked to the social group that you should not like. When we were first investigating the role of disgust in moral judgment  one of the things we became interested in was whether or not these sorts of appeals are more likely to work in individuals who are more easily disgusted. So while disgust  along with the other basic emotions  are universal phenomena  it just really is true that some people are easier to disgust than others. You could probably see it in the audience members when I showed you those disgusting images. The way that we measured this was by a scale that was constructed by some other psychologists that simply asked people across a wide variety of situations how likely they are to feel disgust. So here are a couple of examples.  Even if I were hungry  I would not drink a bowl of my favorite soup if it had been stirred by a used but thoroughly washed fly swatter.   Do you agree or disagree    Laughter   While you are walking through a tunnel under a railroad track  you smell urine. Would you be very disgusted or not at all disgusted   If you ask enough of these  you can get a general overall score of disgust sensitivity. It turns out that this score is actually meaningful. When you bring people into the laboratory and you ask them if they're willing to engage in safe but disgusting behaviors like eating chocolate that's been baked to look like dog poop  or in this case eating some mealworms that are perfectly healthy but pretty gross  your score on that scale actually predicts whether or not you'll be willing to engage in those behaviors. The first time that we set out to collect data on this and associate it with political or moral beliefs  we found a general pattern    this is with the psychologists Yoel Inbar and Paul Bloom    that in fact  across three studies we kept finding that people who reported that they were easily disgusted also reported that they were more politically conservative. Another way to say this  though  is that people who are very liberal are very hard to disgust.  Laughter  In a more recent follow up study  we were able to look at a much greater sample  a much larger sample. In this case  this is nearly        U.S. respondents  and we find the same pattern. As you can see  people who are on the very conservative side of answering the political orientation scale are also much more likely to report that they're easily disgusted. This data set also allowed us to statistically control for a number of things that we knew were both related to political orientation and to disgust sensitivity. So we were able to control for gender  age  income  education  even basic personality variables  and the result stays the same. When we actually looked at not just self reported political orientation  but voting behavior  we were able to look geographically across the nation. What we found was that in regions in which people reported high levels of disgust sensitivity  McCain got more votes. So it not only predicted self reported political orientation  but actual voting behavior. And also we were able  with this sample  to look across the world  in     different countries we asked the same questions  and as you can see  this is     countries collapsed into    different geographical regions. No matter where you look  what this is plotting is the size of the relationship between disgust sensitivity and political orientation  and no matter where we looked  we saw a very similar effect. Other labs have actually looked at this as well using different measures of disgust sensitivity  so rather than asking people how easily disgusted they are  they hook people up to physiological measures  in this case skin conductance. And what they've demonstrated is that people who report being more politically conservative are also more physiologically aroused when you show them disgusting images like the ones that I showed you. Interestingly  what they also showed in a finding that we kept getting in our previous studies as well was that one of the strongest influences here is that individuals who are very disgust sensitive not only are more likely to report being politically conservative  but they're also very much more opposed to gay marriage and homosexuality and pretty much a lot of the socio moral issues in the sexual domain. So physiological arousal predicted  in this study  attitudes toward gay marriage. But even with all these data linking disgust sensitivity and political orientation  one of the questions that remains is what is the causal link here  Is it the case that disgust really is shaping political and moral beliefs  We have to resort to experimental methods to answer this  and so what we can do is actually bring people into the lab and disgust them and compare them to a control group that hasn't been disgusted. It turns out that over the past five years a number of researchers have done this  and by and large the results have all been the same  that when people are feeling disgust  their attitudes shift towards the right of the political spectrum  toward more moral conservatism as well. So this is whether you use a foul odor  a bad taste  from film clips  from post hypnotic suggestions of disgust  images like the ones I've shown you  even just reminding people that disease is prevalent and they should be wary of it and wash up  right  to keep clean  these all have similar effects on judgment. Let me just give you an example from a recent study that we conducted. We asked participants to just simply give us their opinion of a variety of social groups  and we either made the room smell gross or not. When the room smelled gross  what we saw was that individuals actually reported more negative attitudes toward gay men. Disgust didn't influence attitudes toward all the other social groups that we asked  including African Americans  the elderly. It really came down to the attitudes they had toward gay men. In another set of studies we actually simply reminded people    this was at a time when the swine flu was going around    we reminded people that in order to prevent the spread of the flu that they ought to wash their hands. For some participants  we actually had them take questionnaires next to a sign that reminded them to wash their hands. And what we found was that just taking a questionnaire next to this hand sanitizing reminder made individuals report being more politically conservative. And when we asked them a variety of questions about the rightness or wrongness of certain acts  what we also found was that simply being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them more morally conservative. In particular  when we asked them questions about sort of taboo but fairly harmless sexual practices  just being reminded that they ought to wash their hands made them think that they were more morally wrong. Let me give you an example of what I mean by harmless but taboo sexual practice. We gave them scenarios. One of them said a man is house sitting for his grandmother. When his grandmother's away  he has sex with his girlfriend on his grandma's bed. In another one  we said a woman enjoys masturbating with her favorite teddy bear cuddled next to her.  Laughter  People find these to be more morally abhorrent if they've been reminded to wash their hands.  Laughter  Okay. The fact that emotions influence our judgment should come as no surprise. I mean  that's part of how emotions work. They not only motivate you to behave in certain ways  but they change the way you think. In the case of disgust  what is a little bit more surprising is the scope of this influence. It makes perfect sense  and it's a very good emotion for us to have  that disgust would make me change the way that I perceive the physical world whenever contamination is possible. It makes less sense that an emotion that was built to prevent me from ingesting poison should predict who I'm going to vote for in the upcoming presidential election. The question of whether disgust ought to influence our moral and political judgments certainly has to be complex  and might depend on exactly what judgments we're talking about  and as a scientist  we have to conclude sometimes that the scientific method is just ill equipped to answer these sorts of questions. But one thing that I am fairly certain about is  at the very least  what we can do with this research is point to what questions we ought to ask in the first place. Thank you.  Applause  Having spent    years as a child of the state in children's homes and foster care  you could say that I'm an expert on the subject  and in being an expert  I want to let you know that being an expert does in no way make you right in light of the truth. If you're in care  legally the government is your parent  loco parentis. Margaret Thatcher was my mother.  Laughter  Let's not talk about breastfeeding.  Laughter  Harry Potter was a foster child. Pip from  Great Expectations  was adopted  Superman was a foster child  Cinderella was a foster child  Lisbeth Salander  the girl with the dragon tattoo  was fostered and institutionalized  Batman was orphaned  Lyra Belacqua from Philip Pullman's  Northern Lights  was fostered  Jane Eyre  adopted  Roald Dahl's James from  James and the Giant Peach   Matilda  Moses    Moses   Laughter  Moses   Laughter     the boys in Michael Morpurgo's  Friend or Foe   Alem in Benjamin Zephaniah's  Refugee Boy   Luke Skywalker    Luke Skywalker   Laughter     Oliver Twist  Cassia in  The Concubine of Shanghai  by Hong Ying  Celie in Alice Walker's  The Color Purple.  All of these great fictional characters  all of them who were hurt by their condition  all of them who spawned thousands of other books and other films  all of them were fostered  adopted or orphaned. It seems that writers know that the child outside of family reflects on what family truly is more than what it promotes itself to be. That is  they also use extraordinary skills to deal with extraordinary situations on a daily basis. How have we not made the connection  And why have we not made the connection  between   How has that happened    between these incredible characters of popular culture and religions  and the fostered  adopted or orphaned child in our midst  It's not our pity that they need. It's our respect. I know famous musicians  I know actors and film stars and millionaires and novelists and top lawyers and television executives and magazine editors and national journalists and dustbinmen and hairdressers  all who were looked after children  fostered  adopted or orphaned  and many of them grow into their adult lives in fear of speaking of their background  as if it may somehow weaken their standing in the foreground  as if it were somehow Kryptonite  as if it were a time bomb strapped on the inside. Children in care  who've had a life in care  deserve the right to own and live the memory of their own childhood. It is that simple. My own mother   and I should say this here   she same to this country in the late '  s  and she was  you know  she found herself pregnant  as women did in the late '  s. You know what I mean  They found themselves pregnant. And she sort of  she had no idea of the context in which she'd landed. In the     s    I should give you some context    in the     s  if you were pregnant and you were single  you were seen as a threat to the community. You were separated from your family by the state. You were separated from your family and placed into mother and baby homes. You were appointed a social worker. The adoptive parents were lined up. It was the primary purpose of the social worker  the aim  to get the woman at her most vulnerable time in her entire life  to sign the adoption papers. So the adoption papers were signed. The mother and baby's homes were often run by nuns. The adoption papers were signed  the child was given to the adoptive parents  and the mother shipped back to her community to say that she'd been on a little break. A little break. A little break. The first secret of shame for a woman for being a woman   a little break.  The adoption process took  like  a matter of months  so it was a closed shop  you know  sealed deal  an industrious  utilitarian solution  the government  the farmer  the adopting parents  the consumer  the mother  the earth  and the child  the crop. It's kind of easy to patronize the past  to forego our responsibilities in the present. What happened then is a direct reflection of what is happening now. Everybody believed themselves to be doing the right thing by God and by the state for the big society  fast tracking adoption. So anyway  she comes here        she's pregnant  and she comes from Ethiopia that was celebrating its own jubilee at the time under the Emperor Haile Selassie  and she lands months before the Enoch Powell speech  the  Rivers of Blood  speech. She lands months before the Beatles release  The White Album   months before Martin Luther King was killed. It was a summer of love if you were white. If you were black  it was a summer of hate. So she goes from Oxford  she's sent to the north of England to a mother and baby home  and appointed a social worker. It's her plan. You know  I have to say this in the Houses    It's her plan to have me fostered for a short period of time while she studies. But the social worker  he had a different agenda. He found the foster parents  and he said to them   Treat this as an adoption. He's yours forever. His name is Norman.   Laughter  Norman   Laughter  Norman  So they took me. I was a message  they said. I was a sign from God  they said. I was Norman Mark Greenwood. Now  for the next    years  all I know is that this woman  this birth woman  should have her eyes scratched out for not signing the adoption papers. She was an evil woman too selfish to sign  so I spent those    years kneeling and praying. I tried praying. I swear I tried praying.  God  can I have a bike for Christmas   But I would always answer myself   Yes  of course you can.  And then I was supposed to determine whether that was the voice of God or it was the voice of the Devil. And it turns out I've got the Devil inside of me. Who knew   Laughter  So anyway  two years sort of passed  and they had a child of their own  and then another two years passed  and they had another child of their own  and then another time passed and they had another child that they called an accident  which I thought was an unusual name.  Laughter  And I was on the cusp of  sort of  adolescence  so I was starting to take biscuits from the tin without asking. I was starting to stay out a little bit late  etc.  etc. Now  in their religiosity  in their naivete  my mom and dad  which I believed them to be forever  as they said they were  my mom and dad conceived that I had the Devil inside of me. And what    I should say this here  because this is how they engineered my leaving. They sat me at a table  my foster mom  and she said to me   You don't love us  do you   At    years old. They've had three other children. I'm the fourth. The third was an accident. And I said   Yeah  of course I do.  Because you do. My foster mother asked me to go away to think about love and what it is and to read the Scriptures and to come back tomorrow and give my most honest and truthful answer. So this was an opportunity. If they were asking me whether I loved them or not  then I mustn't love them  which led me to the miracle of thought that I thought they wanted me to get to.  I will ask God for forgiveness and His light will shine through me to them. How fantastic.  This was an opportunity. The theology was perfect  the timing unquestionable  and the answer as honest as a sinner could get.  I mustn't love you   I said to them.  But I will ask God for forgiveness.   Because you don't love us  Norman  clearly you've chosen your path.  Twenty four hours later  my social worker  this strange man who used to visit me every couple of months  he's waiting for me in the car as I say goodbye to my parents. I didn't say goodbye to anybody  not my mother  my father  my sisters  my brothers  my aunts  my uncles  my cousins  my grandparents  nobody. On the way to the children's home  I started to ask myself   What's happened to me   It's not that I'd had the rug pulled from beneath me as much as the entire floor had been taken away. When I got to the   For the next four  five years  I was held in four different children's homes. On the third children's home  at     I started to rebel  and what I did was  I got three tins of paint  Airfix paint that you use for models  and I was    it was a big children's home  big Victorian children's home    and I was in a little turret at the top of it  and I poured them  red  yellow and green  the colors of Africa  down the tiles. You couldn't see it from the street  because the home was surrounded by beech trees. For doing this  I was incarcerated for a year in an assessment center which was actually a remand center. It was a virtual prison for young people. By the way  years later  my social worker said that I should never have been put in there. I wasn't charged for anything. I hadn't done anything wrong. But because I had no family to inquire about me  they could do anything to me. I'm    years old  and they had a padded cell. They would march me down corridors in last size order. They    I was put in a dormitory with a confirmed Nazi sympathizer. All of the staff were ex police    interesting    and ex probation officers. The man who ran it was an ex army officer. Every time I had a visit by a person who I did not know who would feed me grapes  once every three months  I was strip searched. That home was full of young boys who were on remand for things like murder. And this was the preparation that I was being given after    years as a child of the state. I have to tell this story. I have to tell it  because there was no one to put two and two together. I slowly became aware that I knew nobody that knew me for longer than a year. See  that's what family does. It gives you reference points. I'm not defining a good family from a bad family. I'm just saying that you know when your birthday is by virtue of the fact that somebody tells you when your birthday is  a mother  a father  a sister  a brother  an aunt  an uncle  a cousin  a grandparent. It matters to someone  and therefore it matters to you. Understand  I was    years old  tucked away in myself  into myself  and I wasn't touched either  physically touched. I'm reporting back. I'm reporting back simply to say that when I left the children's home I had two things that I wanted to do. One was to find my family  and the other was to write poetry. In creativity I saw light. In the imagination I saw the endless possibility of life  the endless truth  the permanent creation of reality  the place where anger was an expression in the search for love  a place where dysfunction is a true reaction to untruth. I've just got to say it to you all  I found all of my family in my adult life. I spent all of my adult life finding them  and I've now got a fully dysfunctional family just like everybody else. But I'm reporting back to you to say quite simply that you can define how strong a democracy is by how its government treats its child. I don't mean children. I mean the child of the state. Thanks very much. It's been an honor.  Applause  I was one of those kids that  every time I got in the car  I basically had to roll down the window. It was usually too hot  too stuffy or just too smelly  and my father would not let us use the air conditioner. He said that it would overheat the engine. And you might remember  some of you  how the cars were back then  and it was a common problem of overheating. But it was also the signal that capped the use  or overuse  of energy consuming devices. Things have changed now. We have cars that we take across country. We blast the air conditioning the entire way  and we never experience overheating. So there's no more signal for us to tell us to stop. Great  right  Well  we have similar problems in buildings. In the past  before air conditioning  we had thick walls. The thick walls are great for insulation. It keeps the interior very cool during the summertime  and warm during the wintertime  and the small windows were also very good because it limited the amount of temperature transfer between the interior and exterior. Then in about the     s  with the advent of plate glass  rolled steel and mass production  we were able to make floor to ceiling windows and unobstructed views  and with that came the irreversible reliance on mechanical air conditioning to cool our solar heated spaces. Over time  the buildings got taller and bigger  our engineering even better  so that the mechanical systems were massive. They require a huge amount of energy. They give off a lot of heat into the atmosphere  and for some of you may understand the heat island effect in cities  where the urban areas are much more warm than the adjacent rural areas  but we also have problems that  when we lose power  we can't open a window here  and so the buildings are uninhabitable and have to be made vacant until that air conditioning system can start up again. Even worse  with our intention of trying to make buildings move towards a net zero energy state  we can't do it just by making mechanical systems more and more efficient. We need to look for something else  and we've gotten ourselves a little bit into a rut. So what do we do here  How do we pull ourselves and dig us out of this hole that we've dug  If we look at biology  and many of you probably don't know  I was a biology major before I went into architecture  the human skin is the organ that naturally regulates the temperature in the body  and it's a fantastic thing. That's the first line of defense for the body. It has pores  it has sweat glands  it has all these things that work together very dynamically and very efficiently  and so what I propose is that our building skins should be more similar to human skin  and by doing so can be much more dynamic  responsive and differentiated  depending on where it is. And this gets me back to my research. What I proposed first doing is looking at a different material palette to do that. I presently  or currently  work with smart materials  and a smart thermo bimetal. First of all  I guess we call it smart because it requires no controls and it requires no energy  and that's a very big deal for architecture. What it is  it's a lamination of two different metals together. You can see that here by the different reflection on this side. And because it has two different coefficients of expansion  when heated  one side will expand faster than the other and result in a curling action. So in early prototypes I built these surfaces to try to see how the curl would react to temperature and possibly allow air to ventilate through the system  and in other prototypes did surfaces where the multiplicity of having these strips together can try to make bigger movement happen when also heated  and currently have this installation at the Materials   Applications gallery in Silver Lake  close by  and it's there until August  if you want to see it. It's called  Bloom   and the surface is made completely out of thermo bimetal  and its intention is to make this canopy that does two things. One  it's a sun shading device  so that when the sun hits the surface  it constricts the amount of sun passing through  and in other areas  it's a ventilating system  so that hot  trapped air underneath can actually move through and out when necessary. You can see here in this time lapse video that the sun  as it moves across the surface  as well as the shade  each of the tiles moves individually. Keep in mind  with the digital technology that we have today  this thing was made out of about        pieces and there's no two pieces alike at all. Every single one is different. And the great thing with that is the fact that we can calibrate each one to be very  very specific to its location  to the angle of the sun  and also how the thing actually curls. So this kind of proof of concept project has a lot of implications to actual future application in architecture  and in this case  here you see a house  that's for a developer in China  and it's actually a four story glass box. It's still with that glass box because we still want that visual access  but now it's sheathed with this thermo bimetal layer  it's a screen that goes around it  and that layer can actually open and close as that sun moves around on that surface. In addition to that  it can also screen areas for privacy  so that it can differentiate from some of the public areas in the space during different times of day. And what it basically implies is that  in houses now  we don't need drapes or shutters or blinds anymore because we can sheath the building with these things  as well as control the amount of air conditioning you need inside that building. I'm also looking at trying to develop some building components for the market  and so here you see a pretty typical double glazed window panel  and in that panel  between those two pieces of glass  that double glazing  I'm trying to work on making a thermo bimetal pattern system so that when the sun hits that outside layer and heats that interior cavity  that thermo bimetal will begin to curl  and what actually will happen then is it'll start to block out the sun in certain areas of the building  and totally  if necessary. And so you can imagine  even in this application  that in a high rise building where the panel systems go from floor to floor up to        floors  the entire surface could be differentiated at different times of day depending on how that sun moves across and hits that surface. And these are some later studies that I'm working on right now that are on the boards  where you can see  in the bottom right hand corner  with the red  it's actually smaller pieces of thermometal  and it's actually going to  we're trying to make it move like cilia or eyelashes. This last project is also of components. The influence    and if you have noticed  one of my spheres of influence is biology    is from a grasshopper. And grasshoppers have a different kind of breathing system. They breathe through holes in their sides called spiracles  and they bring the air through and it moves through their system to cool them down  and so in this project  I'm trying to look at how we can consider that in architecture too  how we can bring air through holes in the sides of a building. And so you see here some early studies of blocks  where those holes are actually coming through  and this is before the thermo bimetal is applied  and this is after the bimetal is applied. Sorry  it's a little hard to see  but on the surfaces  you can see these red arrows. On the left  it's when it's cold and the thermo bimetal is flat so it will constrict air from passing through the blocks  and on the right  the thermo bimetal curls and allows that air to pass through  so those are two different components that I'm working on  and again  it's a completely different thing  because you can imagine that air could potentially be coming through the walls instead of opening windows. So I want to leave you with one last impression about the project  or this kind of work and using smart materials. When you're tired of opening and closing those blinds day after day  when you're on vacation and there's no one there on the weekends to be turning off and on the controls  or when there's a power outage  and you have no electricity to rely on  these thermo bimetals will still be working tirelessly  efficiently and endlessly. Thank you.  Applause  Good morning. So magic is an excellent way for staying ahead of the reality curve  to make possible today what science will make a reality tomorrow. As a cyber magician  I combine elements of illusion and science to give us a feel of how future technologies might be experienced. You've probably all heard of Google's Project Glass. It's new technology. You look through them and the world you see is augmented with data  names of places  monuments  buildings  maybe one day even the names of the strangers that pass you on the street. So these are my illusion glasses. They're a little bigger. They're a prototype. And when you look through them  you get a glimpse into the mind of the cyber illusionist. Let me show you what I mean. All we need is a playing card. Any card will do. Like this. And let me mark it so we can recognize it when we see it again. All right. Very significant mark. And let's put it back into the deck  somewhere in the middle  and let's get started. Voice  System ready. Acquiring image. Marco Tempest  For those of you who don't play cards  a deck of cards is made up of four different suits  hearts  clubs  diamonds and spades. The cards are amongst the oldest of symbols  and have been interpreted in many different ways. Now  some say that the four suits represent the four seasons. There's spring  summer  autumn and     Voice  My favorite season is winter.MT  Well yeah  mine too. Winter is like magic. It's a time of change  when warmth turns to cold  water turns to snow  and then it all disappears. There are    cards in each suit.  Music  Voice  Each card represents a phase of the    lunar cycles. MT  So over here is low tide  and over here is high tide  and in the middle is the moon. Voice  The moon is one of the most potent symbols of magic. MT  There are two colors in a deck of cards. There is the color red and the color black  representing the constant change from day to night. Voice  Marco  I did not know you could do that.  Laughter  MT  And is it a coincidence that there are    cards in a deck of cards  just as there are    weeks in a year  Voice  If you total all the spots on a deck of cards  the result is    . MT  Oh       the number of days in a year  the number of days between each birthday. Make a wish.  Blowing noise  Voice  Don't tell  or it won't come true. MT  Well  as a matter of fact  it was on my sixth birthday that I received my first deck of cards  and ever since that day  I have traveled around the world performing magic for boys and girls  men and women  husbands and wives  even kings and queens.  Applause  Voice  And who are these MT  Ah  mischief makers. Watch. Wake up. Joker  Whoa.MT  Are you ready for your party piece  Joker  Ready MT  Let me see what you've got. Joker  Presenting my pogo stick.MT  Ah. Watch out. Joker  Whoa  whoa  whoa  oh   Music  MT  But today  I am performing for a different kind of audience. I'm performing for you. Voice  Signed card detected.MT  Well  sometimes people ask me how do you become a magician  Is it a   to   job  Of course not  You've got to practice     . I don't literally mean    hours  seven days a week.      is a little bit of an exaggeration  but it does take practice. Now  some people will say  well  magic  that must be the work of some evil supernatural force.  Laughter   Applause  Whoa. Well  to this  I just say  no no. Actually  in German  it's nein nein.  Laughter  Magic isn't that intense. I have to warn you  though  if you ever play with someone who deals cards like this  don't play for money. Voice  Why not  That's a very good hand. The odds of getting it are       to one. MT  Yeah  but I guess my hand is better. We beat the odds. Voice  I think you got your birthday wish.MT  And that actually leaves me with the last  and most important card of all  the one with this very significant mark on it. And unlike anything else we've just seen  virtual or not.Voice  Signed card detected. Digital MT  This is without a question the real thing. MT  Bye bye.  Music  Thank you.  Applause  Thank you very much.  Applause  So little Billy goes to school  and he sits down and the teacher says   What does your father do   And little Billy says   My father plays the piano in an opium den.  So the teacher rings up the parents  and says   Very shocking story from little Billy today. Just heard that he claimed that you play the piano in an opium den.  And the father says   I'm very sorry. Yes  it's true  I lied. But how can I tell an eight year old boy that his father is a politician    Laughter  Now  as a politician myself  standing in front of you  or indeed  meeting any stranger anywhere in the world  when I eventually reveal the nature of my profession  they look at me as though I'm somewhere between a snake  a monkey and an iguana  and through all of this  I feel  strongly  that something is going wrong. Four hundred years of maturing democracy  colleagues in Parliament who seem to me  as individuals  reasonably impressive  an increasingly educated  energetic  informed population  and yet a deep  deep sense of disappointment. My colleagues in Parliament include  in my new intake  family doctors  businesspeople  professors  distinguished economists  historians  writers  army officers ranging from colonels down to regimental sergeant majors. All of them  however  including myself  as we walk underneath those strange stone gargoyles just down the road  feel that we've become less than the sum of our parts  feel as though we have become profoundly diminished. And this isn't just a problem in Britain. It's a problem across the developing world  and in middle income countries too. In Jamaica  for example    look at Jamaican members of Parliament  you meet them  and they're often people who are Rhodes Scholars  who've studied at Harvard or at Princeton  and yet  you go down to downtown Kingston  and you are looking at one of the most depressing sites that you can see in any middle income country in the world  a dismal  depressing landscape of burnt and half abandoned buildings. And this has been true for    years  and the handover in             between one Jamaican leader who was the son of a Rhodes Scholar and a Q.C. to another who'd done an economics doctorate at Harvard  over     people were killed in the streets in drug related violence. Ten years ago  however  the promise of democracy seemed to be extraordinary. George W. Bush stood up in his State of the Union address in      and said that democracy was the force that would beat most of the ills of the world. He said  because democratic governments respect their own people and respect their neighbors  freedom will bring peace. Distinguished academics at the same time argued that democracies had this incredible range of side benefits. They would bring prosperity  security  overcome sectarian violence  ensure that states would never again harbor terrorists. Since then  what's happened  Well  what we've seen is the creation  in places like Iraq and Afghanistan  of democratic systems of government which haven't had any of those side benefits. In Afghanistan  for example  we haven't just had one election or two elections. We've gone through three elections  presidential and parliamentary. And what do we find  Do we find a flourishing civil society  a vigorous rule of law and good security  No. What we find in Afghanistan is a judiciary that is weak and corrupt  a very limited civil society which is largely ineffective  a media which is beginning to get onto its feet but a government that's deeply unpopular  perceived as being deeply corrupt  and security that is shocking  security that's terrible. In Pakistan  in lots of sub Saharan Africa  again you can see democracy and elections are compatible with corrupt governments  with states that are unstable and dangerous. And when I have conversations with people  I remember having a conversation  for example  in Iraq  with a community that asked me whether the riot we were seeing in front of us  this was a huge mob ransacking a provincial council building  was a sign of the new democracy. The same  I felt  was true in almost every single one of the middle and developing countries that I went to  and to some extent the same is true of us. Well  what is the answer to this  Is the answer to just give up on the idea of democracy  Well  obviously not. It would be absurd if we were to engage again in the kind of operations we were engaged in  in Iraq and Afghanistan if we were to suddenly find ourselves in a situation in which we were imposing anything other than a democratic system. Anything else would run contrary to our values  it would run contrary to the wishes of the people on the ground  it would run contrary to our interests. I remember in Iraq  for example  that we went through a period of feeling that we should delay democracy. We went through a period of feeling that the lesson learned from Bosnia was that elections held too early enshrined sectarian violence  enshrined extremist parties  so in Iraq in      the decision was made  let's not have elections for two years. Let's invest in voter education. Let's invest in democratization. The result was that I found stuck outside my office a huge crowd of people  this is actually a photograph taken in Libya but I saw the same scene in Iraq of people standing outside screaming for the elections  and when I went out and said   What is wrong with the interim provincial council  What is wrong with the people that we have chosen  There is a Sunni sheikh  there's a Shiite sheikh  there's the seven    leaders of the seven major tribes  there's a Christian  there's a Sabian  there are female representatives  there's every political party in this council  what's wrong with the people that we chose   The answer came   The problem isn't the people that you chose. The problem is that you chose them.  I have not met  in Afghanistan  in even the most remote community  anybody who does not want a say in who governs them. Most remote community  I have never met a villager who does not want a vote. So we need to acknowledge that despite the dubious statistics  despite the fact that    percent of people in Britain feel politics is broken  despite the fact that when I was in Iraq  we did an opinion poll in      and asked people what political systems they preferred  and the answer came back that seven percent wanted the United States  five percent wanted France  three percent wanted Britain  and nearly    percent wanted Dubai  which is  after all  not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous minor monarchy  democracy is a thing of value for which we should be fighting. But in order to do so we need to get away from instrumental arguments. We need to get away from saying democracy matters because of the other things it brings. We need to get away from feeling  in the same way  human rights matters because of the other things it brings  or women's rights matters for the other things it brings. Why should we get away from those arguments  Because they're very dangerous. If we set about saying  for example  torture is wrong because it doesn't extract good information  or we say  you need women's rights because it stimulates economic growth by doubling the size of the work force  you leave yourself open to the position where the government of North Korea can turn around and say   Well actually  we're having a lot of success extracting good information with our torture at the moment   or the government of Saudi Arabia to say   Well  our economic growth's okay  thank you very much  considerably better than yours  so maybe we don't need to go ahead with this program on women's rights.  The point about democracy is not instrumental. It's not about the things that it brings. The point about democracy is not that it delivers legitimate  effective  prosperous rule of law. It's not that it guarantees peace with itself or with its neighbors. The point about democracy is intrinsic. Democracy matters because it reflects an idea of equality and an idea of liberty. It reflects an idea of dignity  the dignity of the individual  the idea that each individual should have an equal vote  an equal say  in the formation of their government. But if we're really to make democracy vigorous again  if we're ready to revivify it  we need to get involved in a new project of the citizens and the politicians. Democracy is not simply a question of structures. It is a state of mind. It is an activity. And part of that activity is honesty. After I speak to you today  I'm going on a radio program called  Any Questions   and the thing you will have noticed about politicians on these kinds of radio programs is that they never  ever say that they don't know the answer to a question. It doesn't matter what it is. If you ask about child tax credits  the future of the penguins in the south Antarctic  asked to hold forth on whether or not the developments in Chongqing contribute to sustainable development in carbon capture  and we will have an answer for you. We need to stop that  to stop pretending to be omniscient beings. Politicians also need to learn  occasionally  to say that certain things that voters want  certain things that voters have been promised  may be things that we cannot deliver or perhaps that we feel we should not deliver. And the second thing we should do is understand the genius of our societies. Our societies have never been so educated  have never been so energized  have never been so healthy  have never known so much  cared so much  or wanted to do so much  and it is a genius of the local. One of the reasons why we're moving away from banqueting halls such as the one in which we stand  banqueting halls with extraordinary images on the ceiling of kings enthroned  the entire drama played out here on this space  where the King of England had his head lopped off  why we've moved from spaces like this  thrones like that  towards the town hall  is we're moving more and more towards the energies of our people  and we need to tap that. That can mean different things in different countries. In Britain  it could mean looking to the French  learning from the French  getting directly elected mayors in place in a French commune system. In Afghanistan  it could have meant instead of concentrating on the big presidential and parliamentary elections  we should have done what was in the Afghan constitution from the very beginning  which is to get direct local elections going at a district level and elect people's provincial governors. But for any of these things to work  the honesty in language  the local democracy  it's not just a question of what politicians do. It's a question of what the citizens do. For politicians to be honest  the public needs to allow them to be honest  and the media  which mediates between the politicians and the public  needs to allow those politicians to be honest. If local democracy is to flourish  it is about the active and informed engagement of every citizen. In other words  if democracy is to be rebuilt  is to become again vigorous and vibrant  it is necessary not just for the public to learn to trust their politicians  but for the politicians to learn to trust the public. Thank you very much indeed.  Applause  I grew up in Bihar  India's poorest state  and I remember when I was six years old  I remember coming home one day to find a cart full of the most delicious sweets at our doorstep. My brothers and I dug in  and that's when my father came home. He was livid  and I still remember how we cried when that cart with our half eaten sweets was pulled away from us. Later  I understood why my father got so upset. Those sweets were a bribe from a contractor who was trying to get my father to award him a government contract. My father was responsible for building roads in Bihar  and he had developed a firm stance against corruption  even though he was harassed and threatened. His was a lonely struggle  because Bihar was also India's most corrupt state  where public officials were enriching themselves   rather  than serving the poor who had no means to express their anguish if their children had no food or no schooling. And I experienced this most viscerally when I traveled to remote villages to study poverty. And as I went village to village  I remember one day  when I was famished and exhausted  and I was almost collapsing in a scorching heat under a tree  and just at that time  one of the poorest men in that village invited me into his hut and graciously fed me. Only I later realized that what he fed me was food for his entire family for two days. This profound gift of generosity challenged and changed the very purpose of my life. I resolved to give back. Later  I joined the World Bank  which sought to fight such poverty by transferring aid from rich to poor countries. My initial work focused on Uganda  where I focused on negotiating reforms with the Finance Ministry of Uganda so they could access our loans. But after we disbursed the loans  I remember a trip in Uganda where I found newly built schools without textbooks or teachers  new health clinics without drugs  and the poor once again without any voice or recourse. It was Bihar all over again. Bihar represents the challenge of development  abject poverty surrounded by corruption. Globally   .  billion people live on less than   .   a day  and the work I did in Uganda represents the traditional approach to these problems that has been practiced since       when winners of World War II      founding fathers  and one lonely founding mother  gathered in New Hampshire  USA  to establish the Bretton Woods institutions  including the World Bank. And that traditional approach to development had three key elements. First  transfer of resources from rich countries in the North to poorer countries in the South  accompanied by reform prescriptions. Second  the development institutions that channeled these transfers were opaque  with little transparency of what they financed or what results they achieved. And third  the engagement in developing countries was with a narrow set of government elites with little interaction with the citizens  who are the ultimate beneficiaries of development assistance. Today  each of these elements is opening up due to dramatic changes in the global environment. Open knowledge  open aid  open governance  and together  they represent three key shifts that are transforming development and that also hold greater hope for the problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar. The first key shift is open knowledge. You know  developing countries today will not simply accept solutions that are handed down to them by the U.S.  Europe or the World Bank. They get their inspiration  their hope  their practical know how  from successful emerging economies in the South. They want to know how China lifted     million people out of poverty in    years  how Mexico's Oportunidades program improved schooling and nutrition for millions of children. This is the new ecosystem of open knowledge flows  not just traveling North to South  but South to South  and even South to North  with Mexico's Oportunidades today inspiring New York City. And just as these North to South transfers are opening up  so too are the development institutions that channeled these transfers. This is the second shift  open aid. Recently  the World Bank opened its vault of data for public use  releasing       economic and social indicators for     countries over    years  and it launched a global competition to crowdsource innovative apps using this data. Development institutions today are also opening for public scrutiny the projects they finance. Take GeoMapping. In this map from Kenya  the red dots show where all the schools financed by donors are located  and the darker the shade of green  the more the number of out of school children. So this simple mashup reveals that donors have not financed any schools in the areas with the most out of school children  provoking new questions. Is development assistance targeting those who most need our help  In this manner  the World Bank has now GeoMapped        project activities in     countries  and donors are using a common platform to map all their projects. This is a tremendous leap forward in transparency and accountability of aid. And this leads me to the third  and in my view  the most significant shift in development  open governance. Governments today are opening up just as citizens are demanding voice and accountability. From the Arab Spring to the Anna Hazare movement in India  using mobile phones and social media not just for political accountability but also for development accountability. Are governments delivering services to the citizens  So for instance  several governments in Africa and Eastern Europe are opening their budgets to the public. But  you know  there is a big difference between a budget that's public and a budget that's accessible. This is a public budget.  Laughter  And as you can see  it's not really accessible or understandable to an ordinary citizen that is trying to understand how the government is spending its resources. To tackle this problem  governments are using new tools to visualize the budget so it's more understandable to the public. In this map from Moldova  the green color shows those districts that have low spending on schools but good educational outcomes  and the red color shows the opposite. Tools like this help turn a shelf full of inscrutable documents into a publicly understandable visual  and what's exciting is that with this openness  there are today new opportunities for citizens to give feedback and engage with government. So in the Philippines today  parents and students can give real time feedback on a website  Checkmyschool.org  or using SMS  whether teachers and textbooks are showing up in school  the same problems I witnessed in Uganda and in Bihar. And the government is responsive. So for instance  when it was reported on this website that     students were at risk because school repairs had stalled due to corruption  the Department of Education in the Philippines took swift action. And you know what's exciting is that this innovation is now spreading South to South  from the Philippines to Indonesia  Kenya  Moldova and beyond. In Dar es Salaam  Tanzania  even an impoverished community was able to use these tools to voice its aspirations. This is what the map of Tandale looked like in August      . But within a few weeks  university students were able to use mobile phones and an open source platform to dramatically map the entire community infrastructure. And what is very exciting is that citizens were then able to give feedback as to which health or water points were not working  aggregated in the red bubbles that you see  which together provides a graphic visual of the collective voices of the poor. Today  even Bihar is turning around and opening up under a committed leadership that is making government transparent  accessible and responsive to the poor. But  you know  in many parts of the world  governments are not interested in opening up or in serving the poor  and it is a real challenge for those who want to change the system. These are the lonely warriors like my father and many  many others  and a key frontier of development work is to help these lonely warriors join hands so they can together overcome the odds. So for instance  today  in Ghana  courageous reformers from civil society  Parliament and government  have forged a coalition for transparent contracts in the oil sector  and  galvanized by this  reformers in Parliament are now investigating dubious contracts. These examples give new hope  new possibility to the problems I witnessed in Uganda or that my father confronted in Bihar. Two years ago  on April  th        I called my father. It was very late at night  and at age     he was typing a    page public interest litigation against corruption in a road project. Though he was no lawyer  he argued the case in court himself the next day. He won the ruling  but later that very evening  he fell  and he died. He fought till the end  increasingly passionate that to combat corruption and poverty  not only did government officials need to be honest  but citizens needed to join together to make their voices heard. These became the two bookends of his life  and the journey he traveled in between mirrored the changing development landscape. Today  I'm inspired by these changes  and I'm excited that at the World Bank  we are embracing these new directions  a significant departure from my work in Uganda    years ago. We need to radically open up development so knowledge flows in multiple directions  inspiring practitioners  so aid becomes transparent  accountable and effective  so governments open up and citizens are engaged and empowered with reformers in government. We need to accelerate these shifts. If we do  we will find that the collective voices of the poor will be heard in Bihar  in Uganda  and beyond. We will find that textbooks and teachers will show up in schools for their children. We will find that these children  too  have a real chance of breaking their way out of poverty. Thank you.  Applause  What I want you all to do right now is to think of this mammal that I'm going to describe to you. The first thing I'm going to tell you about this mammal is that it is essential for our ecosystems to function correctly. If we remove this mammal from our ecosystems  they simply will not work. That's the first thing. The second thing is that due to the unique sensory abilities of this mammal  if we study this mammal  we're going to get great insight into our diseases of the senses  such as blindness and deafness. And the third really intriguing aspect of this mammal is that I fully believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies deep within its DNA. So are you all thinking  So  magnificent creature  isn't it  Who here thought of a bat  Ah  I can see half the audience agrees with me  and I have a lot of work to do to convince the rest of you. So I have had the good fortune for the past    years to study these fascinating and beautiful mammals. One fifth of all living mammals is a bat  and they have very unique attributes. Bats as we know them have been around on this planet for about    million years. One of the most unique things that bats do as a mammal is that they fly. Now flight is an inherently difficult thing. Flight within vertebrates has only evolved three times  once in the bats  once in the birds  and once in the pterodactyls. And so with flight  it's very metabolically costly. Bats have learned and evolved how to deal with this. But one other extremely unique thing about bats is that they are able to use sound to perceive their environment. They use echolocation. Now  what I mean by echolocation    they emit a sound from their larynx out through their mouth or through their nose. This sound wave comes out and it reflects and echoes back off objects in their environment  and the bats then hear these echoes and they turn this information into an acoustic image. And this enables them to orient in complete darkness. Indeed  they do look very strange. We're humans. We're a visual species. When scientists first realized that bats were actually using sound to be able to fly and orient and move at night  we didn't believe it. For a hundred years  despite evidence to show that this is what they were doing  we didn't believe it. Now  if you look at this bat  it looks a little bit alien. Indeed  the very famous philosopher Thomas Nagel once said   To truly experience an alien life form on this planet  you should lock yourself inside a room with a flying  echolocating bat in complete darkness.  And if you look at the actual physical characteristics on the face of this beautiful horseshoe bat  you see a lot of these characteristics are dedicated to be able to make sound and perceive it. Very big ears  strange nose leaves  but teeny tiny eyes. So again  if you just look at this bat  you realize sound is very important for its survival. Most bats look like the previous one. However  there are a group that do not use echolocation. They do not perceive their environment using sound  and these are the flying foxes. If anybody has ever been lucky enough to be in Australia  you've seen them coming out of the Botanic Gardens in Sydney  and if you just look at their face  you can see they have much  much larger eyes and much smaller ears. So among and within bats is a huge variation in their ability to use sensory perception. Now this is going to be important for what I'm going to tell you later during the talk. Now  if the idea of bats in your belfry terrifies you  and I know some people probably are feeling a little sick looking at very large images of bats  that's probably not that surprising  because here in Western culture  bats have been demonized. Really  of course the famous book  Dracula   written by a fellow Northside Dubliner Bram Stoker  probably is mainly responsible for this. However  I also think it's got to do with the fact that bats come out at night  and we don't really understand them. We're a little frightened by things that can perceive the world slightly differently than us. Bats are usually synonymous with some type of evil events. They are the perpetrators in horror movies  such as this famous  Nightwing.  Also  if you think about it  demons always have bat wings  whereas birds  they typically    or angels have bird wings. Now  this is Western society  and what I hope to do tonight is to convince you of the Chinese traditional culture  that they perceive bats as creatures that bring good luck  and indeed  if you walk into a Chinese home  you may see an image such as this. This is considered the Five Blessings. The Chinese word for  bat  sounds like the Chinese word for  happiness   and they believe that bats bring wealth  health  longevity  virtue and serenity. And indeed  in this image  you have a picture of longevity surrounded by five bats. And what I want to do tonight is to talk to you and to show you that at least three of these blessings are definitely represented by a bat  and that if we study bats we will get nearer to getting each of these blessings. So  wealth    how can a bat possibly bring us wealth  Now as I said before  bats are essential for our ecosystems to function correctly. And why is this  Bats in the tropics are major pollinators of many plants. They also feed on fruit  and they disperse the seeds of these fruits. Bats are responsible for pollinating the tequila plant  and this is a multi million dollar industry in Mexico. So indeed  we need them for our ecosystems to function properly. Without them  it's going to be a problem. But most bats are voracious insect predators. It's been estimated in the U.S.  in a tiny colony of big brown bats  that they will feed on over a million insects a year  and in the United States of America  right now bats are being threatened by a disease known as white nose syndrome. It's working its way slowly across the U.S. and wiping out populations of bats  and scientists have estimated that       metric tons of insects a year are now remaining in the ecosystems due to the loss of bats. Bats are also threatened in the U.S. by their attraction to wind farms. Again  right now bats are looking at a little bit of a problem. They're going to    They are very threatened in the United States of America alone. Now how can this help us  Well  it has been calculated that if we were to remove bats from the equation  we're going to have to then use insecticides to remove all those pest insects that feed on our agricultural crops. And for one year in the U.S. alone  it's estimated that it's going to cost    billion U.S. dollars  if we remove bats. So indeed  bats then do bring us wealth. They maintain the health of our ecosystems  and also they save us money. So again  that's the first blessing. Bats are important for our ecosystems. And what about the second  What about health  Inside every cell in your body lies your genome. Your genome is made up of your DNA  your DNA codes for proteins that enable you to function and interact and be as you are. Now since the new advancements in modern molecular technologies  it is now possible for us to sequence our own genome in a very rapid time and at a very  very reduced cost. Now when we've been doing this  we've realized that there's variations within our genome. So I want you to look at the person beside you. Just have a quick look. And what we need to realize is that every     base pairs in your DNA  you're a little bit different. And one of the grand challenges right now in modern molecular medicine is to work out whether this variation makes you more susceptible to diseases  or does this variation just make you different  Again  what does it mean here  What does this variation actually mean  So if we are to capitalize on all of this new molecular data and personalized genomic information that is coming online that we will be able to have in the next few years  we have to be able to differentiate between the two. So how do we do this  Well  I believe we just look at nature's experiments. So through natural selection  over time  mutations  variations that disrupt the function of a protein will not be tolerated over time. Evolution acts as a sieve. It sieves out the bad variation. And so therefore  if you look at the same region of a genome in many mammals that have been evolutionarily distant from each other and are also ecologically divergent  you will get a better understanding of what the evolutionary prior of that site is  i.e.  if it is important for the mammal to function  for its survival  it will be the same in all of those different lineages  species  taxa. So therefore  if we were to do this  what we'd need to do is sequence that region in all these different mammals and ascertain if it's the same or if it's different. So if it is the same  this indicates that that site is important for a function  so a disease mutation should fall within that site. So in this case here  if all the mammals that we look at have a yellow type genome at that site  it probably suggests that purple is bad. This could be even more powerful if you look at mammals that are doing things slightly differently. So say  for example  the region of the genome that I was looking at was a region that's important for vision. If we look at that region in mammals that don't see so well  such as bats  and we find that bats that don't see so well have the purple type  we know that this is probably what's causing this disease. So in my lab  we've been using bats to look at two different types of diseases of the senses. We're looking at blindness. Now why would you do this  Three hundred and fourteen million people are visually impaired  and    million of these are blind. So blindness is a big problem  and a lot of these blind disorders come from inherited diseases  so we want to try and better understand which mutations in the gene cause the disease. Also we look at deafness. One in every       newborn babies are deaf  and when we reach     over half of us will also have a hearing problem. Again  there's many underlying genetic causes for this. So what we've been doing in my lab is looking at these unique sensory specialists  the bats  and we have looked at genes that cause blindness when there's a defect in them  genes that cause deafness when there's a defect in them  and now we can predict which sites are most likely to cause disease. So bats are also important for our health  to enable us to better understand how our genome functions. So this is where we are right now  but what about the future  What about longevity  This is where we're going to go  and as I said before  I really believe that the secret of everlasting youth lies within the bat genome. So why should we be interested in aging at all  Well  really  this is a picture drawn from the     s of the Fountain of Youth. Aging is considered one of the most familiar  yet the least well understood  aspects of all of biology  and really  since the dawn of civilization  mankind has sought to avoid it. But we are going to have to understand it a bit better. In Europe alone  by       there is going to be a    percent increase of individuals over     and     percent increase in individuals over   . As we age  we deteriorate  and this deterioration causes problems for our society  so we have to address it. So how could the secret of everlasting youth actually lie within the bat genome  Does anybody want to hazard a guess over how long this bat could live for  Who    put up your hands    who says two years  Nobody  One  How about    years  Some  How about     How about     Okay  it's a whole varied response. This bat is myotis brandtii. It's the longest living bat. It lived for up to    years  and this bat's still alive in the wild today. But what would be so amazing about this  Well  typically  in mammals there is a relationship between body size  metabolic rate  and how long you can live for  and you can predict how long a mammal can live for given its body size. So typically  small mammals live fast  die young. Think of a mouse. But bats are very different. As you can see here on this graph  in blue  these are all other mammals  but bats can live up to nine times longer than expected despite having a really  really high metabolic rate  and the question is  how can they do that  There are    species of mammal that live longer than expected  given their body size  than man  and    of those are bats. So therefore  they must have something within their DNA that ables them to deal with the metabolic stresses  particularly of flight. They expend three times more energy than a mammal of the same size  but don't seem to suffer the consequences or the effects. So right now  in my lab  we're combining state of the art bat field biology  going out and catching the long lived bats  with the most up to date  modern molecular technology to understand better what it is that they do to stop aging as we do. And hopefully in the next five years  I'll be giving you a TEDTalk on that. Aging is a big problem for humanity  and I believe that by studying bats  we can uncover the molecular mechanisms that enable mammals to achieve extraordinary longevity. If we find out what they're doing  perhaps through gene therapy  we can enable us to do the same thing. Potentially  this means that we could halt aging or maybe even reverse it. Just imagine what that would be like. So really  I don't think we should be thinking of them as flying demons of the night  but more as our superheroes. And the reality is that bats can bring us so much benefit if we just look in the right place. They're good for our ecosystem  they allow us to understand how our genome functions  and they potentially hold the secret to everlasting youth. So tonight  when you walk out of here and you look up in the night skies  and you see this beautiful flying mammal  I want you to smile. Thank you.  Applause
