b'Al Gore',Averting the climate crisis,Jun 2006,957,Thank you so much  Chris. And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice  I'm extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference  and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely  partly because  Mock sob  I need that. Put yourselves in my position. I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane  I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me. It's a true story    every bit of this is true. Soon after Tipper and I left the     Mock sob  White House    we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have    miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves. I know it sounds like a little thing to you  but    I looked in the rear view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there. You've heard of phantom limb pain  This was a rented Ford Taurus. It was dinnertime  and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I   . We got to Exit      Lebanon  Tennessee. We got off the exit  we found a Shoney's restaurant. Low cost family restaurant chain  for those of you who don't know it. We went in and sat down at the booth  and the waitress came over  made a big commotion over Tipper. She took our order  and then went to the couple in the booth next to us  and she lowered her voice so much  I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. And she said  Yes  that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife  Tipper.  And the man said   He's come down a long way  hasn't he   There's been kind of a series of epiphanies. The very next day  continuing the totally true story  I got on a G V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria  in the city of Lagos  on the topic of energy. And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you  Tipper and I were driving ourselves  Shoney's  low cost family restaurant chain  what the man said    they laughed. I gave my speech  then went back out to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until  during the middle of the night  we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up  they opened the door  I went out to get some fresh air  and I looked  and there was a man running across the runway. And he was waving a piece of paper  and he was yelling   Call Washington  Call Washington   And I thought to myself  in the middle of the night  in the middle of the Atlantic  what in the world could be wrong in Washington  Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. But what it turned out to be  was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech  and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey  I checked. And the story began   Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday   quote  'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low cost family restaurant'      'named Shoney's  and we are running it ourselves.'  Before I could get back to U.S. soil  David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on    one of them had me in a big white chef's hat  Tipper was saying   One more burger with fries   Three days later  I got a nice  long  handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton  saying   Congratulations on the new restaurant  Al   We like to celebrate each other's successes in life. I was going to talk about information ecology. But I was thinking that  since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED  that maybe I could talk about that another time. Chris Anderson  It's a deal  Al Gore  I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on  What can you do about the climate crisis  I want to start with a couple of    I'm going to show some new images  and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. Now  the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it. I add new images  because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach combing  you know  Every time the tide comes in and out  you find some more shells. Just in the last two days  we got the new temperature records in January. This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for Januarys is    degrees  last month was   .  degrees. Now  I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment    I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides  and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. First of all  this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming  under business as usual. Efficiency in end use electricity and end use of all energy is the low hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation    it's not a cost  it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative  it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path. Cars and trucks    I talked about that in the slideshow  but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy  visible target of concern    and it should be    but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant  and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod  and John Doerr and others  many of you here    there are a lot of people directly involved in this    this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration    that's what CCS stands for    is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now  what can you do  Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation  better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles    buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important. Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy  between things that have a harsh effect  or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. Consider this  Make a decision to live a carbon neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding  I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here have made that decision  and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make  and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened    with my active involvement    the leading software writers in the world  on this arcane science of carbon calculation  to construct a consumer friendly carbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate what your CO  emissions are  and then you will be given options to reduce. And by the time the movie comes out in May  this will be updated to  .   and we will have click through purchases of offsets. Next  consider making your business carbon neutral. Again  some of us have done that  and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations  whether you are from the technology  or entertainment  or design and architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen  if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance  don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. Over time  people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested  based on the short term returns  you're going to get short term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. Become a catalyst of change. Teach others  learn about it  talk about it. The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago  except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow    re purposed  with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach  and it's not just the slides  it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse  in communities all across the country  and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week  to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig  it will be  somewhere in that process  posted with tools and limited use copyrights  so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way. Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics  It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican  that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue  and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions    global warming pollution    and trading it. Here's why  as long as the United States is out of the world system  it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system  with U.S. participation  then everybody who's on a board of directors    how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation  Once it's a closed system  you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem    if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. We have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently  the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done. And in our modern country  the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. It's now repetition of short  hot button     second     second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re brand global warming  as many of you have suggested. I like  climate crisis  instead of  climate collapse   but again  those of you who are good at branding  I need your help on this. Somebody said the test we're facing now  a scientist told me  is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. That's really true. I said the other night  and I'll repeat now  this is not a political issue. Again  the Republicans here    this shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this  but connected to the ideas that are here  to bring more coherence to them. We are one. Thank you very much  I appreciate it.
b'David Pogue',Simplicity sells,Jun 2006,1271,Hello voice mail  my old friend. I've called for tech support again. I ignored my boss's warning. I called on a Monday morning. Now it's evening  and my dinner first grew cold  and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told  but I've still spent    hours on hold. It's not enough your software crashed my Mac  and it constantly hangs and bombs    it erased my ROMs  Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength  you call       and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me. And you listen to the sounds of silence. Thank you. Good evening and welcome to   Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist.  When I was offered the Times column six years ago  the deal was like this  you'll be sent the coolest  hottest  slickest new gadgets. Every week  it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out  play with them  evaluate them until the novelty wears out  before you have to send them back  and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it  if you want. So  I've always been a technology nut  and I absolutely love it. The job  though  came with one small downside  and that is  they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column. And what I've noticed is    first of all  you get an incredible amount of email. If you ever are feeling lonely  get a New York Times column  because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration. People are feeling like things    Ok  I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology  too fast. It may be good technology  but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support  and within    hours  there were     messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website  from users saying    Me too  and here's my tale of woe.  I call it  software rage.  And man  let me tell you  whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will    Oh  how did that get up there  Just kidding. Ok  so why is the problem accelerating  And part of the problem is  ironically  because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer interface used to look like  DOS. Over the years  it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system    this is the good part    the entire operating system fit in     k. You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in     k  So the irony is  that as these things became easier to use  a less technical  broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time. I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to. And the calls that    you know how they say   Your call may be recorded for quality assurance   Uh uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD. Which they do. And I have a copy. It's in your gift bag. No  no. With your voices on it  So  some of the stories are just so classic  and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said   Well  ma'am  what do you mean your mouse is squeaking   She says   All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder  the faster I move it across the screen.  And the technician's like   Ma'am  you've got the mouse up against the screen   She goes   Well  the message said  'Click here to continue.'  Well  if you like that one    how much time have we got  Another one  a guy called    this is absolutely true    his computer had crashed  and he told the technician he couldn't restart it  no matter how many times he typed    .  And the technician said   What  Why are you typing      He said   The message says  'Error Type   .'  So  we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis  the complexity crisis  accelerating now  In the hardware world  it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller  smaller  smaller. So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier  but our fingers are essentially staying the same size. So it gets to be more and more of a challenge. Software is subject to another primal force  the mandate to release more and more versions. When you buy a piece of software  it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar  where you own it. It's more like joining a club  where you pay dues every year  and every year  they say   We've added more features  and we'll sell it to you for    .  I know one guy who's spent        just on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make    percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox    which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times  you eventually ruin it. I mean  Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in  you know  the Eisenhower administration. But what's the alternative  Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said   Well  wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor  Simple  pure  does not do web pages  is not a database.  And it came out  and it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment  because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power  right  They don't need the database and the website  but they're like   Well  I'll upgrade  because  I might  you know  I might need that someday.  So the problem is  as you add more features  where are they going to go  Where are you going to stick them  You only have so many design tools. You can do buttons  you can do sliders  pop up menus  sub menus. But if you're not careful about how you choose  you wind up with this. This is an un retouched    this is not a joke    un retouched photo of Microsoft Word  the copy that you have  with all the toolbars open. You've obviously never opened all the toolbars  but all you have to type in is this little  teeny window down here. And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices  where there are so many features and options  you have to do two dimensions  you know  a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you    it's there. Part of the art of designing a simple  good interface  is knowing when to use which one of these features. So  here is the log off dialogue box for Windows     . There are only four choices  so why are they in a pop up menu  It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view. Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box. Thank you    yes  I designed the dialogue box. No  no. Already  we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design. Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be  let's break it down  let's just make it more steps. There are these  wizards  everywhere. And you know  there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace  there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.  Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard   Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.  Ok  I'll bite. Let's click  Next  to continue. From the drop down menu  choose the first letter you want to type. Ok. So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer  How do you pack in all these features in a simple  intelligent way  I believe in consistency  when possible  real world equivalents  trash can folder  when possible  label things  mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all  which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that  I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent  but it's better. If you are buying something on the web  you're supposed to put in your address  and you're supposed to choose what country you're from  ok  There are     countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village. I'm sorry  it's not one yet. It's mainly like  the United States  Europe  and Japan. So why is  United States  in the  U s  You have to scroll  like  seven screensful to get to it. Now  it would be inconsistent to put  United States  first  but it would be intelligent. This one's been touched on before  but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called  Start   Here's another pet one of mine  you have a printer. Most of the time  you want to print one copy of your document  in page order  on that printer. So why in God's name do you see this every time you print  It's like a     shuttle cockpit. And one of the buttons at the bottom  you'll notice  is not  Print.  Now  I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also  especially in the old days  wonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '  s  and after the talk  I met one of the employees. He says   Nice talk.  And I said   Thank you. What do you do here   He said   I'm a tap counter.  I'm like   You're a what   He goes   Well Jeff Hawkins  the CEO  says  'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus  it's too long  and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter.  So  I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter. This is Microsoft Word. Ok  when you want to create a new blank document in Word    it could happen. You go up to the  File  menu and you choose  New.  Now  what happens when you choose  New   Do you get a new blank document  You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor  a task bar appears  and somewhere in those links    by the way  not at the top    somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document. Ok  so that is a company not counting taps. You know  I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes  I do. The Bill Gates song  I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together  I got profit and they got the loss. I write the code that makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage  but the press is snowed. You buy the box  I'll sell the code. Every software company is doing Microsoft's R D. You can't keep a good idea down these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big  so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code that fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice  you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code. But actually  I believe there are really two Microsofts. There's the old one  responsible for Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh  but they can't. They're locked in  because so many add ons and other company stuff locks into the old      chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft  that's really doing good  simple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market  but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way  would you pay     a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone  and stops working when you leave your area code  So  the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse. So is there any hope  The screens are getting smaller  people are illuminating  putting manuals in the boxes  things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny    when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in       after    years away  it was the MacWorld Expo    he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans  and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild  but I had just seen    I'm like  where have I seen this before  I had just seen the movie  Evita     with Madonna  and I'm like  you know what  I've got to do one about Steve Jobs. It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange. When I try to explain why I'm back  after telling the press Apple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz. You try rhyming with garage  Don't cry for me  Cupertino. The truth is  I never left you. I know the ropes now  know what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar. Don't cry for me  Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days  they're Gucci leather. Thank you. So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is  for years I was a little depressed  because Americans obviously did not value it  because the Mac had three percent market share  Windows had    percent market share    people did not think it was worth putting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk  and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed. But it turns out I was wrong  right  Because the iPod came out  and it violated every bit of common wisdom. Other products cost less  other products had more features  they had voice recorders and FM transmitters. The other products were backed by Microsoft  with an open standard  not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won    this is the one they wanted. The lesson was  simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry is getting the message. This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing    it's catching on. I've got just a couple examples. Physically  a really cool  elegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera  how do you get the pictures back to your computer  Well  you either haul around a USB cable  or you buy a card reader and haul that around. Either one  you're going to lose. What I do is  I take out the memory card  and I fold it in half  revealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer  offload the pictures  put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris  you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug  Chris Anderson  Oh yeah. DP  Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this  this is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord. It hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives  or one of your children. You walk along    and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa  It's magnetic    it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor. In my very last example    I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just    you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly  period. Like  I get hundreds of them a day  period. And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down  period. I also use this feature called voice macros  period. Correct  dissuade.  Not  just.  Ok  this is not an ideal situation  because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff. The point is  I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word  and having it write out a much longer thing. So if somebody sends me a fan letter  I'll say   Thanks for that.   Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...  And conversely  if somebody sends me hate mail    which happens daily    I say   Piss off.   I admire your frankness ...  So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone. So the point is    this is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software  and do you know what they put in version eight  No new features. It's never happened before in software  The company put no new features. They just said   We'll make this software work right.  Right  Because for years  people had bought this software  tried it out       percent accuracy was all they got  which means one in    words is wrong    and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that  so they said   This version  we're not going to do anything  but make sure it's darned accurate.  And so that's what they did. This cult of doing things right is starting to spread. So  my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology  remember  if it doesn't work  it's not necessarily you  ok  It could be the design of the thing you're using. Be aware in life of good design and bad design. And if you're among the people who create this stuff  Easy is hard. Pre sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps. Remember  the hard part is not deciding what features to add  it's deciding what to leave out. And best of all  your motivation is  simplicity sells. CA  Bravo. DP  Thank you very much. CA  Hear  hear 
b'Majora Carter',Greening the ghetto,Jun 2006,1095,If you're here today    and I'm very happy that you are    you've all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves. However  when we're not at TED  we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible  especially in large urban areas like New York City. And that's because most people with decision making powers  in both the public and the private sector  really don't feel as though they're in danger. The reason why I'm here today  in part  is because of a dog    an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain  back in     . She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I'd anticipated. When she came into my life  we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than    percent of the entire city's commercial waste  a sewage treatment pelletizing plant  a sewage sludge plant  four power plants  the world's largest food distribution center  as well as other industries that bring more than        diesel truck trips to the area each week. The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city. So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a         seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects  I thought they were really well meaning  but a bit naive. I'd lived in this area all my life  and you could not get to the river  because of all the lovely facilities that I mentioned earlier. Then  while jogging with my dog one morning  she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump. There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won't mention here  but she kept dragging me  and lo and behold  at the end of that lot was the river. I knew that this forgotten little street end  abandoned like the dog that brought me there  was worth saving. And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community led revitalization of the new South Bronx. And just like my new dog  it was an idea that got bigger than I'd imagined. We garnered much support along the way  and the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than    years. We leveraged that         seed grant more than     times  into a    million park. And in the fall  I'm going to exchange marriage vows with my beloved. Thank you very much. That's him pressing my buttons back there  which he does all the time. But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coal mine. We feel the problems right now  and have for some time. Environmental justice  for those of you who may not be familiar with the term  goes something like this  no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other. Unfortunately  race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff  like parks and trees  and where one might find the bad stuff  like power plants and waste facilities. As a black person in America  I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health. I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility  which I do. These land use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity  diabetes and asthma. Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood  Our    percent obesity rate is high even for this country  and diabetes comes with it. One out of four South Bronx children has asthma. Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average. These impacts are coming everyone's way. And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs  health problems associated with pollution and more odiously  the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men  who possess untold amounts of untapped potential. Fifty percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line     percent of us are unemployed. Low income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary care. This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits. Poor people are not only still poor  they are still unhealthy. Fortunately  there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won't compromise the lives of low income communities of color in the short term  and won't destroy us all in the long term. None of us want that  and we all have that in common. So what else do we have in common  Well  first of all  we're all incredibly good looking. Graduated high school  college  post graduate degrees  traveled to interesting places  didn't have kids in your early teens  financially stable  never been imprisoned. OK. Good. But  besides being a black woman  I am different from most of you in some other ways. I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down. My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam  only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home. Jesus. I grew up with a crack house across the street. Yeah  I'm a poor black child from the ghetto. These things make me different from you. But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community  and I am in between these two worlds with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other. So how did things get so different for us  In the late '  s  my dad    a Pullman porter  son of a slave    bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx  and a few years later  he married my mom. At the time  the community was a mostly white  working class neighborhood. My dad was not alone. And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream  white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country. Red lining was used by banks  wherein certain sections of the city  including ours  were deemed off limits to any sort of investment. Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions    dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding. Hunts Point was formerly a walk to work community  but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to. A national highway construction boom was added to our problems. In New York State  Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway expansion campaign. One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan. The South Bronx  which lies in between  did not stand a chance. Residents were often given less than a month's notice before their buildings were razed.         people were displaced. The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx. And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community  that it's bad and ugly  how could it not reflect on you  So now  my family's property was worthless  save for that it was our home  and all we had. And luckily for me  that home and the love inside of it  along with help from teachers  mentors and friends along the way  was enough. Now  why is this story important  Because from a planning perspective  economic degradation begets environmental degradation  which begets social degradation. The disinvestment that began in the     s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come. Antiquated zoning and land use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood. Are these factors taken into consideration when land use policy is decided  What costs are associated with these decisions  And who pays  Who profits  Does anything justify what the local community goes through  This was  planning     in quotes    that did not have our best interests in mind. Once we realized that  we decided it was time to do our own planning. That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a Greenway movement in the South Bronx. I wrote a one and a quarter million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on street bike paths. Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety  the placement of the waste and other facilities  which  if done properly  don't compromise a community's quality of life. They provide opportunities to be more physically active  as well as local economic development. Think bike shops  juice stands. We secured    million dollars to build first phase projects. This is Lafayette Avenue    and that's redesigned by Mathews Nielsen Landscape Architects. And once this path is constructed  it'll connect the South Bronx with more than     acres of Randall's Island Park. Right now we're separated by about    feet of water  but this link will change that. As we nurture the natural environment  its abundance will give us back even more. We run a project called the Bronx  Environmental  Stewardship Training  which provides job training in the fields of ecological restoration  so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well paying jobs. Little by little  we're seeding the area with green collar jobs    and with people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment. The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era  built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it. Even during rush hour  it goes virtually unused. The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway. We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re envision how this    acres can be better utilized for parkland  affordable housing and local economic development. We also built New York City's first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices. Cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don't absorb solar heat  and pass it on to the building or atmosphere. Green roofs are soil and living plants. Both can be used instead of petroleum based roofing materials that absorb heat  contribute to urban  heat island  effect and degrade under the sun  which we in turn breathe. Green roofs also retain up to    percent of rainfall  so they reduce a city's need to fund costly end of pipe solutions    which  incidentally  are often located in environmental justice communities like mine. And they provide habitats for our little friends   Butterfly  So cool  Anyway  the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business  bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx.  Green is the new black ...  I like that  too. Anyway  I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here  but since I have all of your attention  We need investors. End of pitch. It's better to ask for forgiveness than permission. Anyway    OK. Katrina. Prior to Katrina  the South Bronx and New Orleans' Ninth Ward had a lot in common. Both were largely populated by poor people of color  both hotbeds of cultural innovation  think hip hop and jazz. Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another. In the post Katrina era  we have still more in common. We're at best ignored  and maligned and abused  at worst  by negligent regulatory agencies  pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability. Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable. But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out. We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone. Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two  like the South Bronx did  Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine  Now listen  I do not expect individuals  corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral. This presentation today only represents some of what I've been through. Like a tiny little bit. You've no clue. But I'll tell you later  if you want to know. But    I know it's the bottom line  or one's perception of it  that motivates people in the end. I'm interested in what I like to call the  triple bottom line  that sustainable development can produce. Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned  the developers  government and the community where these projects go up. At present  that's not happening in New York City. And we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit. A parade of government subsidies is going to propose big box and stadium developments in the South Bronx  but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic  pollution  solid waste and the impacts on open space. And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it's not even funny. Because on top of that  the world's richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well loved community parks. Now  we'll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier. And although less than    percent of South Bronx residents own cars  these projects include thousands of new parking spaces  yet zip in terms of mass public transit. Now  what's missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy  environmentally challenged community  versus incorporating structural  sustainable changes. My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues. Now let's get this straight  I am not anti development. Ours is a city  not a wilderness preserve. And I've embraced my inner capitalist. And  but I don't have    You probably all have  and if you haven't  you need to. So I don't have a problem with developers making money. There's enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable  community friendly development can still make a fortune. Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins    both heroes of mine by the way    have shown that you can actually do that. I do have a problem with developments that hyper exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit. That it continues is a shame upon us all  because we are all responsible for the future that we create. But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities  is to learn from visionaries in other cities. This is my version of globalization. Let's take Bogota. Poor  Latino  surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking  a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx. However  this city was blessed in the late     s with a highly influential mayor named Enrique Pe alosa. He looked at the demographics. Few Bogotanos own cars  yet a huge portion of the city's resources was dedicated to serving them. If you're a mayor  you can do something about that. His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three  outlawed parking on those streets  expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes  created public plazas  created one of the most efficient bus mass transit systems in the entire world. For his brilliant efforts  he was nearly impeached. But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day to day lives  incredible things happened. People stopped littering. Crime rates dropped  because the streets were alive with people. His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time  and on a third world budget  at that. We have no excuse in this country  I'm sorry. But the bottom line is  their people first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars  but rather  to provide opportunities for all Bogotanos to participate in the city's resurgence. That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the U.S. But Bogota's example has the power to change that. You  however  are blessed with the gift of influence. That's why you're here and why you value the information we exchange. Use your influence in support of comprehensive  sustainable change everywhere. Don't just talk about it at TED. This is a nationwide policy agenda I'm trying to build  and as you all know  politics are personal. Help me make green the new black. Help me make sustainability sexy. Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations. Help me fight for environmental and economic justice. Support investments with a triple bottom line return. Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table  and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere. Oh good  glad I have a little more time  Listen    when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast  I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy. His response was a grant program. I don't think he understood that I wasn't asking for funding. I was making him an offer. What troubled me was that this top down approach is still around. Now  don't get me wrong  we need money. But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision making process. Of the    percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day  don't add wasting our energy  intelligence and hard earned experience to that count. I have come from so far to meet you like this. Please don't waste me. By working together  we can become one of those small  rapidly growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world. We might have come to this conference from very  very different stations in life  but believe me  we all share one incredibly powerful thing. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
