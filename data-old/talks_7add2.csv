9_11_healing_the_mothers_who_found_forgiveness_friendship,1951,1953,Aicha el-Wafi + Phyllis Rodriguez 2011,Aicha el-Wafi + Phyllis Rodriguez,female,"The mothers who found forgiveness, friendship",May 2011,570,Phyllis Rodriguez  We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship. And it is. And yet  it feels natural to us now. I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September   th      . We didn't know if he had perished yet until    hours later. At the time  we knew that it was political. We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son    my husband  Orlando  and I and our family. And when I saw it    and yet  through the shock  the terrible shock  and the terrible explosion in our lives  literally  we were not vengeful. And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism  and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him  if convicted  my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that  publicly. Through that and through human rights groups  we were brought together with several other victims' families. When I saw Aicha in the media  coming over when her son was indicted  and I thought   What a brave woman. Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger.  I was still in deep grief  I knew I didn't have the strength. I knew I would find her someday  or we would find each other. Because  when people heard that my son was a victim  I got immediate sympathy. But when people learned what her son was accused of  she didn't get that sympathy. But her suffering is equal to mine. So we met in November       and Aicha will now tell you how that came about. I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui. And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims. So they introduced me to five families. And I saw Phyllis  and I watched her. She was the only mother in the group. The others were brothers  sisters. And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother  just like me. I suffered a lot as a mother. I was married when I was   . I lost a child when I was     a second child when I was   . So the story with Zacarias was too much really. And I still suffer  because my son is like he's buried alive. I know she really cried for her son. But she knows where he is. My son  I don't know where he is. I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured. I don't know what happened to him. So that's why I decided to tell my story  so that my suffering is something positive for other women. For all the women  all the mothers that give life  you can give back  you can change. It's up to us women  because we are women  because we love our children. We must be hand in hand and do something together. It's not against women  it's for us  for us women  for our children. I talk against violence  against terrorism. I go to schools to talk to young  Muslim girls so they don't accept to be married against their will very young. So if I can save one of the young girls  and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did  well this is something good. This is why I'm here in front of you. PR  I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha  starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members    which was a very private meeting with security  because it was November       and  frankly  we were afraid of the super patriotism of that time in the country    those of us family members. But we were all so nervous.  Why does she want to meet us   And then she was nervous.  Why did we want to meet her   What did we want from each other  Before we knew each others' names  or anything  we had embraced and wept. Then we sat in a circle with support  with help  from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation. And Aicha started  and she said   I don't know if my son is guilty or innocent  but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families. I know what it is to suffer  and I feel that if there is a crime  a person should be tried fairly and punished.  But she reached out to us in that way  and it was  I'd like to say  it was an ice breaker. And what happened then is we all told our stories  and we all connected as human beings. By the end of the afternoon    it was about three hours after lunch    we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever. Now what I learned from her  is a woman  not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then  and what was being done to her son  but the life she's had. I never had met someone with such a hard life  from such a totally different culture and environment from my own. And I feel that we have a special connection  which I value very much. And I think it's all about being afraid of the other  but making that step and then realizing   Hey  this wasn't so hard. Who else can I meet that I don't know  or that I'm so different from   So  Aicha  do you have a couple of words for conclusion  Because our time is up. that we have to try to know other people  the other. You have to be generous  and your hearts must be generous  your mind must be generous. You must be tolerant. You have to fight against violence. And I hope that someday we'll all live together in peace and respecting each other. This is what I wanted to say.,9/11 mothers,201105,5.89118589744,836750,TEDWomen 2010,2010-12-12,20101212
jonathan_marks_in_praise_of_conflict,1649,1651,Carl Honoré 2007,Carl Honoré,male,In praise of slowness,Feb 2007,1147,What I'd like to start off with is an observation  which is that if I've learned anything over the last year  it's that the supreme irony of publishing a book about slowness is that you have to go around promoting it really fast. I seem to spend most of my time these days zipping from city to city  studio to studio  interview to interview  serving up the book in really tiny bite size chunks. Because everyone these days wants to know how to slow down  but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ... so I did a spot on CNN the other day where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air. And I think that    that's not really surprising though  is it  Because that's kind of the world that we live in now  a world stuck in fast forward. A world obsessed with speed  with doing everything faster  with cramming more and more into less and less time. Every moment of the day feels like a race against the clock. To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher  which is in my bio there  I'll just toss it out again     These days even instant gratification takes too long.   Laughter  And if you think about how we to try to make things better  what do we do  No  we speed them up  don't we  So we used to dial  now we speed dial. We used to read  now we speed read. We used to walk  now we speed walk. And of course  we used to date and now we speed date. And even things that are by their very nature slow    we try and speed them up too. So I was in New York recently  and I walked past a gym that had an advertisement in the window for a new course  a new evening course. And it was for  you guessed it  speed yoga. So this    the perfect solution for time starved professionals who want to  you know  salute the sun  but only want to give over about    minutes to it. I mean  these are sort of the extreme examples  and they're amusing and good to laugh at. But there's a very serious point  and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life  we often lose sight of the damage that this roadrunner form of living does to us. We're so marinated in the culture of speed that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes on every aspect of our lives    on our health  our diet  our work  our relationships  the environment and our community. And sometimes it takes a wake up call  doesn't it  to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives  instead of actually living them  that we're living the fast life  instead of the good life. And I think for many people  that wake up call takes the form of an illness. You know  a burnout  or eventually the body says   I can't take it anymore   and throws in the towel. Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke because we haven't had the time  or the patience  or the tranquility  to be with the other person  to listen to them. And my wake up call came when I started reading bedtime stories to my son  and I found that at the end of day  I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down    you know  I'd be speed reading  The Cat In The Hat.  I'd be    you know  I'd be skipping lines here  paragraphs there  sometimes a whole page  and of course  my little boy knew the book inside out  so we would quarrel. And what should have been the most relaxing  the most intimate  the most tender moment of the day  when a dad sits down to read to his son  became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills  a clash between my speed and his slowness. And this went on for some time  until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article with timesaving tips for fast people. And one of them made reference to a series of books called  The One Minute Bedtime Story.  And I wince saying those words now  but my first reaction at the time was very different. My first reflex was to say   Hallelujah    what a great idea  This is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more.  But thankfully  a light bulb went on over my head  and my next reaction was very different  and I took a step back  and I thought   Whoa    you know  has it really come to this  Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day   And I put away the newspaper    and I was getting on a plane    and I sat there  and I did something I hadn't done for a long time    which is I did nothing. I just thought  and I thought long and hard. And by the time I got off that plane  I'd decided I wanted to do something about it. I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture  and what it was doing to me and to everyone else. And I had two questions in my head. The first was  how did we get so fast  And the second is  is it possible  or even desirable  to slow down  Now  if you think about how our world got so accelerated  the usual suspects rear their heads. You think of  you know  urbanization  consumerism  the workplace  technology. But I think if you cut through those forces  you get to what might be the deeper driver  the nub of the question  which is how we think about time itself. In other cultures  time is cyclical. It's seen as moving in great  unhurried circles. It's always renewing and refreshing itself. Whereas in the West  time is linear. It's a finite resource  it's always draining away. You either use it  or lose it.  Time is money   as Benjamin Franklin said. And I think what that does to us psychologically is it creates an equation. Time is scarce  so what do we do  Well    well  we speed up  don't we  We try and do more and more with less and less time. We turn every moment of every day into a race to the finish line    a finish line  incidentally  that we never reach  but a finish line nonetheless. And I guess that the question is  is it possible to break free from that mindset  And thankfully  the answer is yes  because what I discovered  when I began looking around  that there is a global backlash against this culture that tells us that faster is always better  and that busier is best. Right across the world  people are doing the unthinkable  they're slowing down  and finding that  although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down  you're road kill  the opposite turns out to be true  that by slowing down at the right moments  people find that they do everything better. They eat better  they make love better  they exercise better  they work better  they live better. And  in this kind of cauldron of moments and places and acts of deceleration  lie what a lot of people now refer to as the  International Slow Movement.  Now if you'll permit me a small act of hypocrisy  I'll just give you a very quick overview of what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food  many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement. Started in Italy  but has spread across the world  and now has         members in    countries. And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message  which is that we get more pleasure and more health from our food when we cultivate  cook and consume it at a reasonable pace. I think also the explosion of the organic farming movement  and the renaissance of farmers' markets  are other illustrations of the fact that people are desperate to get away from eating and cooking and cultivating their food on an industrial timetable. They want to get back to slower rhythms. And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something called the Slow Cities movement  which has started in Italy  but has spread right across Europe and beyond. And in this  towns begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape  so that people are encouraged to slow down and smell the roses and connect with one another. So they might curb traffic  or put in a park bench  or some green space. And in some ways  these changes add up to more than the sum of their parts  because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City  it's kind of like a philosophical declaration. It's saying to the rest of world  and to the people in that town  that we believe that in the   st century  slowness has a role to play. In medicine  I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned with the kind of quick fix mentality you find in conventional medicine. And millions of them around the world are turning to complementary and alternative forms of medicine  which tend to tap into sort of slower  gentler  more holistic forms of healing. Now  obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies  and I personally doubt that the coffee enema will ever  you know  gain mainstream approval. But other treatments such as acupuncture and massage  and even just relaxation  clearly have some kind of benefit. And blue chip medical colleges everywhere are starting to study these things to find out how they work  and what we might learn from them. Sex. There's an awful lot of fast sex around  isn't there  I was coming to    well    no pun intended there. I was making my way  let's say  slowly to Oxford  and I went through a news agent  and I saw a magazine  a men's magazine  and it said on the front   How to bring your partner to orgasm in    seconds.  So  you know  even sex is on a stopwatch these days. Now  you know  I like a quickie as much as the next person  but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained from slow sex    from slowing down in the bedroom. You know  you tap into that    those deeper  sort of  psychological  emotional  spiritual currents  and you get a better orgasm with the buildup. You can get more bang for your buck  let's say. I mean  the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently  didn't they  when they sang the praises of  a lover with a slow hand.  Now  we all laughed at Sting a few years ago when he went Tantric  but you fast forward a few years  and now you find couples of all ages flocking to workshops  or maybe just on their own in their own bedrooms  finding ways to put on the brakes and have better sex. And of course  in Italy where    I mean  Italians always seem to know where to find their pleasure    they've launched an official Slow Sex movement. The workplace. Right across much of the world    North America being a notable exception    working hours have been coming down. And Europe is an example of that  and people finding that their quality of life improves as they're working less  and also that their hourly productivity goes up. Now  clearly there are problems with the    hour workweek in France    too much  too soon  too rigid. But other countries in Europe  notably the Nordic countries  are showing that it's possible to have a kick ass economy without being a workaholic. And Norway  Sweden  Denmark and Finland now rank among the top six most competitive nations on Earth  and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American weep with envy. And if you go beyond sort of the country level  down at the micro company level  more and more companies now are realizing that they need to allow their staff either to work fewer hours or just to unplug    to take a lunch break  or to go sit in a quiet room  to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops    you at the back    mobile phones  during the work day or on the weekend  so that they have time to recharge and for the brain to slide into that kind of creative mode of thought. It's not just  though  these days  adults who overwork  though  is it  It's children  too. I'm     and my childhood ended in the mid '  s  and I look at kids now  and I'm just amazed by the way they race around with more homework  more tutoring  more extracurriculars than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago. And some of the most heartrending emails that I get on my website are actually from adolescents hovering on the edge of burnout  pleading with me to write to their parents  to help them slow down  to help them get off this full throttle treadmill. But thankfully  there is a backlash there in parenting as well  and you're finding that  you know  towns in the United States are now banding together and banning extracurriculars on a particular day of the month  so that people can  you know  decompress and have some family time  and slow down. Homework is another thing. There are homework bans springing up all over the developed world in schools which had been piling on the homework for years  and now they're discovering that less can be more. So there was a case up in Scotland recently where a fee paying  high achieving private school banned homework for everyone under the age of     and the high achieving parents freaked out and said   What are you    you know  our kids will fall     the headmaster said   No  no  your children need to slow down at the end of the day.  And just this last month  the exam results came in  and in math  science  marks went up    percent on average last year. And I think what's very revealing is that the elite universities  who are often cited as the reason that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much  are starting to notice the caliber of students coming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks  they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars  to the point that would make your eyes water. But they lack spark  they lack the ability to think creatively and think outside    they don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools  and Oxford and Cambridge and so on  are starting to send a message to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit. And in Harvard  for instance  they send out a letter to undergraduates    freshmen    telling them that they'll get more out of life  and more out of Harvard  if they put on the brakes  if they do less  but give time to things  the time that things need  to enjoy them  to savor them. And even if they sometimes do nothing at all. And that letter is called    very revealing  I think     Slow Down      with an exclamation mark on the end. So wherever you look  the message  it seems to me  is the same  that less is very often more  that slower is very often better. But that said  of course  it's not that easy to slow down  is it  I mean  you heard that I got a speeding ticket while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness  and that's true  but that's not all of it. I was actually en route to a dinner held by Slow Food at the time. And if that's not shaming enough  I got that ticket in Italy. And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway  you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going. But why is it so hard to slow down  I think there are various reasons. One is that speed is fun  you know  speed is sexy. It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up. I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension    that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off from the bigger  deeper questions. We fill our head with distraction  with busyness  so that we don't have to ask  am I well  Am I happy  Are my children growing up right  Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf  Another reason    although I think  perhaps  the most powerful reason    why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo that we've erected against slowing down.  Slow  is a dirty word in our culture. It's a byword for  lazy    slacker   for being somebody who gives up. You know   he's a bit slow.  It's actually synonymous with being stupid. I guess what the Slow Movement    the purpose of the Slow Movement  or its main goal  really  is to tackle that taboo  and to say that yes  sometimes slow is not the answer  that there is such a thing as  bad slow.  You know  I got stuck on the M    which is a ring road around London  recently  and spent three and a half hours there. And I can tell you  that's really bad slow. But the new idea  the sort of revolutionary idea  of the Slow Movement  is that there is such a thing as  good slow   too. And good slow is  you know  taking the time to eat a meal with your family  with the TV switched off. Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles in the office to make the best decision at work. Or even simply just taking the time to slow down and savor your life. Now  one of the things that I found most uplifting about all of this stuff that's happened around the book since it came out  is the reaction to it. And I knew that when my book on slowness came out  it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade  but it's also been taken up  with great gusto  by the corporate world    you know  business press  but also big companies and leadership organizations. Because people at the top of the chain  people like you  I think  are starting to realize that there's too much speed in the system  there's too much busyness  and it's time to find  or get back to that lost art of shifting gears. Another encouraging sign  I think  is that it's not just in the developed world that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world  in countries that are on the verge of making that leap into first world status    China  Brazil  Thailand  Poland  and so on    these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement  many people in them  and there's a debate going on in their media  on the streets. Because I think they're looking at the West  and they're saying   Well  we like that aspect of what you've got  but we're not so sure about that.  So all of that said  is it  I guess  is it possible  That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible to slow down  And I'm happy to be able to say to you that the answer is a resounding yes. And I present myself as Exhibit A  a kind of reformed and rehabilitated speed aholic. I still love speed. You know  I live in London  and I work as a journalist  and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness  and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things. I play squash and ice hockey  two very fast sports  and I wouldn't give them up for the world. But I've also  over the last year or so  got in touch with my inner tortoise. And what that means is that I no longer overload myself gratuitously. My default mode is no longer to be a rush aholic. I no longer hear time's winged chariot drawing near  or at least not as much as I did before. I can actually hear it now  because I see my time is ticking off. And the upshot of all of that is that I actually feel a lot happier  healthier  more productive than I ever have. I feel like I'm living my life rather than actually just racing through it. And perhaps  the most important measure of the success of this is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper  richer  stronger. And for me  I guess  the litmus test for whether this would work  and what it would mean  was always going to be bedtime stories  because that's sort of where the journey began. And there too the news is rosy. You know  at the end of the day  I go into my son's room. I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer  so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket  and I just slow down to his pace and we read. And because children have their own tempo and internal clock  they don't do quality time  where you schedule    minutes for them to open up to you. They need you to move at their rhythm. I find that    minutes into a story  you know  my son will suddenly say   You know  something happened in the playground today that really bothered me.  And we'll go off and have a conversation on that. And I now find that bedtime stories used to be a box on my to do list  something that I dreaded  because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly. It's become my reward at the end of the day  something I really cherish. And I have a kind of Hollywood ending to my talk this afternoon  which goes a little bit like this  a few months ago  I was getting ready to go on another book tour  and I had my bags packed. I was downstairs by the front door  and I was waiting for a taxi  and my son came down the stairs and he'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it. He'd gone and stapled two cards  very like these  together  and put a sticker of his favorite character  Tintin  on the front. And he said to me  or he handed this to me  and I read it  and it said   To Daddy  love Benjamin.  And I thought   Aw  that's really sweet. Is that a good luck on the book tour card   And he said   No  no  no  Daddy    this is a card for being the best story reader in the world.  And I thought   Yeah  you know  this slowing down thing really does work.  Thank you very much.,nan,200702,6.02008097166,1186390,TEDxPSU,2017-02-12,20170212
christopher_m00t_poole_the_case_for_anonymity_online,1715,1717,"Christopher ""moot"" Poole"" 2010","Christopher ""moot"" Poole""",male,The case for anonymity online,Jun 2010,670,Tom Green  That's a  chan thing. These kids on the Internet  they have this group of kids and they like to say funny words like  barrel roll.  It's a video game move from  Star Fox.   Star Fox       Assistant   Star Fox   .   Tom Green  Yeah. And they've been dogging me for a year. I got to tell you  it's driving me nuts  actually. Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream    chan   Christopher Poole  When I was     I found this website called Futaba Channel. And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard. That format of forum  at that time  was not well known outside of Japan. And so what I did is I took it  I translated it into English  and I stuck it up for my friends to use. Now  six and a half years later  over seven million people are using it  contributing over         posts per day. And we've gone from one board to    boards. This is what it looks like. So  what's unique about the site is that it's anonymous  and it has no memory. There's no archive  there are no barriers  there's no registration. These things that we're used to with forums don't exist on  chan. And that's led to this discussion that's completely raw  completely unfiltered. What the site's known for  because it has this environment  is it's fostered the creation of a lot of Internet phenomena  viral videos and whatnot  known as  memes.  Two of the largest memes that have come out of this site some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats    just silly pictures of cats with text. And this resonates with millions of people  apparently  because there are tens of thousands of these  and there is a whole blogging empire now dedicated to pictures like these. And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth these past two years ... Rickroll was this bait and switch  really simple  classic bait and switch. Somebody says they're linking to something interesting  and you get an '  s pop song. That's all it was. And it got big enough to the point where there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade  and Rick Astley pops out  and rickrolls millions of people on television. There are thousands of memes that come out of the site. There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream  the ones I've just shown you  but every day  every month  people are producing thousands of these. So does a site like this have rules  We do  they're the codified rules that I've come up with  which are more or less ignored by the community. And so they've come up with their own set of rules  the  Rules of the Internet.  And so there are three that I want to show you specifically. Rule one is you don't talk about  b . Two is you do not talk about  b . And this one's kind of interesting   If it exists  there is porn of it. No exceptions.  And I will spare you that slide. I assure you  it is very true.  b  is the first board we started with  and it is  in many ways  the beating heart of the website. It is where a third of all the traffic is going. And  b  is known for  more than anything  not just the memes they've created  but the exploits. And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago  and that was the Time     poll. So somebody at Time  at the magazine  thought it would be fun to nominate me for this thing they did last year. And so they placed me on it  and the Internet got wind of it. My community decided they wanted me to win it. I didn't instruct them to do it  they just decided that that's what they wanted. And so  you know      percent approval rating ain't so bad. So they broke that poll. And I ended up on top. I ended up at this really fancy party. But that's not what's interesting about this. It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list  they were actually    it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed all of the top    places to spell  mARBLECAKE. ALSO  THE GAME.  The amount of time and effort that went into that is absolutely incredible. And  marble cake  is significant because it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized. Anonymous is this group of people that protested  very famously  Scientology. The story is  Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online. They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet. And so these people  over       people  less than one month later  organized in a hundred cities around the globe and    this is L.A.    protested the Church of Scientology  and they have continued to do so  now  two full years after the fact. They are still protesting. So we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group that's come out of the site. And last  I'm going to show you the example  the story of Dusty the cat. Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat. This young man posted a video of him abusing his cat on YouTube. And  you know  this didn't sit well with people  and so there was this outpouring of support for people to do something about this. So what they did is they    I mean  they put CSI to shame here    the Internet detectives came out. They matched  they found his MySpace. They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video. Within    hours  they had his name  and within    hours  he was arrested. And so  what I think is really intriguing about a community like  chan is just that it's this open place. As I said  it's raw  it's unfiltered. And sites like it are kind of going the way of the dinosaur right now. They're endangered because we're moving towards social networking. We're moving towards persistent identity. We're moving towards  you know  a lack of privacy  really. We're sacrificing a lot of that  and I think in doing so  moving towards those things  we're losing something valuable. Thank you. Chris Anderson  Thank you. Got a couple questions for you. But if I ask them  is the TED website going to go down  CP  You're lucky that this is not being streamed to them live right now. CA  Well  you never know. Some of them    we've got people in    countries out there watching. Don't tell. But seriously  this issue on anonymity is    I mean  you made the case there. But anonymity basically allows people to say anything  all the rules gone. You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography. And I'm just curious whether you sometimes lie awake in the night worrying that you've opened Pandora's box. CP  Yes and no. I mean  for as much good that kind of comes out of this environment  there is plenty of bad. There are plenty of downsides. But I think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people    there are very few places  now  where you can go and not have identity  to be completely anonymous and say whatever you'd like. And saying whatever you like  I think  is powerful. Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line. But I think it's important to have these places. When I get emails  people say   Thank you for giving me this place  this outlet  where I can come after work and be myself.  CA  But words  saying things  you know  can be constructive  it can be really damaging. And if you cut the link between what is said and any attribution back to you  I mean  surely there are huge risks with that. CP  There are  certainly. But    CA  Tell me about what    I mean  I think you asked the board what you might say at TED  right  CP  Yeah  I posted a thread on Sunday. And within    hours  it had over        responses. And the thing is  I didn't make it into that presentation because I can't read to you anything that they said  more or less.    percent of it is just  would have been  you know  bleeped out. But there were some good things that came out of that too. Love and peace were mentioned. CA  Love and peace were mentioned  kind of with quote marks around them  right  CP  Cats and dogs were mentioned too. CA  And that content is all off the board now. Right  it's gone  Or is it still up there  CP  I stuck that thread so it lasted a few days. It went up to about        posts  and now it has been taken off. CA  Okay  well. Now  I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway. Chris  you yourself  I mean  you're a figure of some intrigue. You've got this surprising semi underground influence  but it's not making you a lot of money  yet. What's the commercial picture here  CP  The commercial picture is that there really isn't much of one  I guess. The site has adult content on it. I mean  obviously  it's got some very offensive  obscene content on it  just in terms of language alone. And when you've got that  you've pretty much sacrificed any hope of making lots of money. CA  But you still live at home  right  CP  I actually moved out recently. CA  That's very cool. CP  I got out of Mom's  and I'm back in school right now. CA  But what conversations did you or do you have with your mother about  chan  CP  At first  very kind of pained  awkward conversations. The content is not dinner table conversation in the least. But my parents    I think part of why they kind of are able to appreciate it is because they don't understand it. CA  And they were probably pleased to see you on top of the Time poll. CP  Yeah. They still didn't know what to think of that though. CA  And so  in    years' time  what do you picture yourself doing  CP  That's a good question. As I said  I just went back to school  and I am considering majoring in urban studies and then going on to urban planning  kind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities and trying to adapt that to a physical community. CA  Chris  thank you. Absolutely fascinating. Thank you for coming to TED.,nan,201006,6.08720194647,1466795,TED2010,2010-02-12,20100212
defend_our_freedom_to_share_or_why_sopa_is_a_bad_idea,60,62,Clay Shirky 2012,Clay Shirky,male,Why SOPA is a bad idea,Jan 2012,823,I'm going to start here. This is a hand lettered sign that appeared in a mom and pop bakery in my old neighborhood in Brooklyn a few years ago. The store owned one of those machines that can print on plates of sugar. And kids could bring in drawings and have the store print a sugar plate for the top of their birthday cake. But unfortunately  one of the things kids liked to draw was cartoon characters. They liked to draw the Little Mermaid  they'd like to draw a smurf  they'd like to draw Micky Mouse. But it turns out to be illegal to print a child's drawing of Micky Mouse onto a plate of sugar. And it's a copyright violation. And policing copyright violations for children's birthday cakes was such a hassle that the College Bakery said   You know what  we're getting out of that business. If you're an amateur  you don't have access to our machine anymore. If you want a printed sugar birthday cake  you have to use one of our prefab images    only for professionals.  So there's two bills in Congress right now. One is called SOPA  the other is called PIPA. SOPA stands for the Stop Online Piracy Act. It's from the Senate. PIPA is short for PROTECTIP  which is itself short for Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property    because the congressional aides who name these things have a lot of time on their hands. And what SOPA and PIPA want to do is they want to do this. They want to raise the cost of copyright compliance to the point where people simply get out of the business of offering it as a capability to amateurs. Now the way they propose to do this is to identify sites that are substantially infringing on copyright    although how those sites are identified is never fully specified in the bills    and then they want to remove them from the domain name system. They want to take them out of the domain name system. Now the domain name system is the thing that turns human readable names  like Google.com  into the kinds of addresses machines expect      .   .   .   . Now the problem with this model of censorship  of identifying a site and then trying to remove it from the domain name system  is that it won't work. And you'd think that would be a pretty big problem for a law  but Congress seems not to have let that bother them too much. Now the reason it won't work is that you can still type   .   .   .    into the browser or you can make it a clickable link and you'll still go to Google. So the policing layer around the problem becomes the real threat of the act. Now to understand how Congress came to write a bill that won't accomplish its stated goals  but will produce a lot of pernicious side effects  you have to understand a little bit about the back story. And the back story is this  SOPA and PIPA  as legislation  were drafted largely by media companies that were founded in the   th century. The   th century was a great time to be a media company  because the thing you really had on your side was scarcity. If you were making a TV show  it didn't have to be better than all other TV shows ever made  it only had to be better than the two other shows that were on at the same time    which is a very low threshold of competitive difficulty. Which meant that if you fielded average content  you got a third of the U.S. public for free    tens of millions of users for simply doing something that wasn't too terrible. This is like having a license to print money and a barrel of free ink. But technology moved on  as technology is wont to do. And slowly  slowly  at the end of the   th century  that scarcity started to get eroded    and I don't mean by digital technology  I mean by analog technology. Cassette tapes  video cassette recorders  even the humble Xerox machine created new opportunities for us to behave in ways that astonished the media business. Because it turned out we're not really couch potatoes. We don't really like to only consume. We do like to consume  but every time one of these new tools came along  it turned out we also like to produce and we like to share. And this freaked the media businesses out    it freaked them out every time. Jack Valenti  who was the head lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America  once likened the ferocious video cassette recorder to Jack the Ripper and poor  helpless Hollywood to a woman at home alone. That was the level of rhetoric. And so the media industries begged  insisted  demanded that Congress do something. And Congress did something. By the early   s  Congress passed the law that changed everything. And that law was called the Audio Home Recording Act of     . What the Audio Home Recording Act of      said was  look  if people are taping stuff off the radio and then making mixtapes for their friends  that is not a crime. That's okay. Taping and remixing and sharing with your friends is okay. If you make lots and lots of high quality copies and you sell them  that's not okay. But this taping business  fine  let it go. And they thought that they clarified the issue  because they'd set out a clear distinction between legal and illegal copying. But that wasn't what the media businesses wanted. They had wanted Congress to outlaw copying full stop. So when the Audio Home Recording Act of      was passed  the media businesses gave up on the idea of legal versus illegal distinctions for copying because it was clear that if Congress was acting in their framework  they might actually increase the rights of citizens to participate in our own media environment. So they went for plan B. It took them a while to formulate plan B. Plan B appeared in its first full blown form in         something called the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. It was a complicated piece of legislation  a lot of moving parts. But the main thrust of the DMCA was that it was legal to sell you uncopyable digital material    except that there's no such things as uncopyable digital material. It would be  as Ed Felton once famously said   Like handing out water that wasn't wet.  Bits are copyable. That's what computers do. That is a side effect of their ordinary operation. So in order to fake the ability to sell uncopyable bits  the DMCA also made it legal to force you to use systems that broke the copying function of your devices. Every DVD player and game player and television and computer you brought home    no matter what you thought you were getting when you bought it    could be broken by the content industries  if they wanted to set that as a condition of selling you the content. And to make sure you didn't realize  or didn't enact their capabilities as general purpose computing devices  they also made it illegal for you to try to reset the copyability of that content. The DMCA marks the moment when the media industries gave up on the legal system of distinguishing between legal and illegal copying and simply tried to prevent copying through technical means. Now the DMCA had  and is continuing to have  a lot of complicated effects  but in this one domain  limiting sharing  it has mostly not worked. And the main reason it hasn't worked is the Internet has turned out to be far more popular and far more powerful than anyone imagined. The mixtape  the fanzine  that was nothing compared to what we're seeing now with the Internet. We are in a world where most American citizens over the age of    share things with each other online. We share written things  we share images  we share audio  we share video. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've found. Some of the stuff we share is stuff we've made out of what we've found  and all of it horrifies those industries. So PIPA and SOPA are round two. But where the DMCA was surgical    we want to go down into your computer  we want to go down into your television set  down into your game machine  and prevent it from doing what they said it would do at the store    PIPA and SOPA are nuclear and they're saying  we want to go anywhere in the world and censor content. Now the mechanism  as I said  for doing this  is you need to take out anybody pointing to those IP addresses. You need to take them out of search engines  you need to take them out of online directories  you need to take them out of user lists. And because the biggest producers of content on the Internet are not Google and Yahoo  they're us  we're the people getting policed. Because in the end  the real threat to the enactment of PIPA and SOPA is our ability to share things with one another. So what PIPA and SOPA risk doing is taking a centuries old legal concept  innocent until proven guilty  and reversing it    guilty until proven innocent. You can't share until you show us that you're not sharing something we don't like. Suddenly  the burden of proof for legal versus illegal falls affirmatively on us and on the services that might be offering us any new capabilities. And if it costs even a dime to police a user  that will crush a service with a hundred million users. So this is the Internet they have in mind. Imagine this sign everywhere    except imagine it doesn't say College Bakery  imagine it says YouTube and Facebook and Twitter. Imagine it says TED  because the comments can't be policed at any acceptable cost. The real effects of SOPA and PIPA are going to be different than the proposed effects. The threat  in fact  is this inversion of the burden of proof  where we suddenly are all treated like thieves at every moment we're given the freedom to create  to produce or to share. And the people who provide those capabilities to us    the YouTubes  the Facebooks  the Twitters and TEDs    are in the business of having to police us  or being on the hook for contributory infringement. There's two things you can do to help stop this    a simple thing and a complicated thing  an easy thing and a hard thing. The simple thing  the easy thing  is this  if you're an American citizen  call your representative  call your senator. When you look at the people who co signed on the SOPA bill  people who've co signed on PIPA  what you see is that they have cumulatively received millions and millions of dollars from the traditional media industries. You don't have millions and millions of dollars  but you can call your representatives  and you can remind them that you vote  and you can ask not to be treated like a thief  and you can suggest that you would prefer that the Internet not be broken. And if you're not an American citizen  you can contact American citizens that you know and encourage them to do the same. Because this seems like a national issue  but it is not. These industries will not be content with breaking our Internet. If they break it  they will break it for everybody. That's the easy thing. That's the simple thing. The hard thing is this  get ready  because more is coming. SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA  which was purposed last year  which did not pass. And all of this goes back to the failure of the DMCA to disallow sharing as a technical means. And the DMCA goes back to the Audio Home Recording Act  which horrified those industries. Because the whole business of actually suggesting that someone is breaking the law and then gathering evidence and proving that  that turns out to be really inconvenient.  We'd prefer not to do that   says the content industries. And what they want is not to have to do that. They don't want legal distinctions between legal and illegal sharing. They just want the sharing to go away. PIPA and SOPA are not oddities  they're not anomalies  they're not events. They're the next turn of this particular screw  which has been going on    years now. And if we defeat these  as I hope we do  more is coming. Because until we convince Congress that the way to deal with copyright violation is the way copyright violation was dealt with with Napster  with YouTube  which is to have a trial with all the presentation of evidence and the hashing out of facts and the assessment of remedies that goes on in democratic societies. That's the way to handle this. In the meantime  the hard thing to do is to be ready. Because that's the real message of PIPA and SOPA. Time Warner has called and they want us all back on the couch  just consuming    not producing  not sharing    and we should say   No.  Thank you.,Social Media Theorist,201201,5.85989939638,1283564,TEDSalon NY2012,2012-01-17,20120117
the_interspecies_internet_an_idea_in_progress,493,495,"Diana Reiss, Peter Gabriel, Neil Gershenfeld and Vint Cerf 2013","Diana Reiss, Peter Gabriel, Neil Gershenfeld and Vint Cerf",both,The interspecies internet? An idea in progress,Jul 2013,11,Diana Reiss  You may think you're looking through a window at a dolphin spinning playfully  but what you're actually looking through is a two way mirror at a dolphin looking at itself spinning playfully. This is a dolphin that is self aware. This dolphin has self awareness. It's a young dolphin named Bayley. I've been very interested in understanding the nature of the intelligence of dolphins for the past    years. How do we explore intelligence in this animal that's so different from us  And what I've used is a very simple research tool  a mirror  and we've gained great information  reflections of these animal minds. Dolphins aren't the only animals  the only non human animals  to show mirror self recognition. We used to think this was a uniquely human ability  but we learned that the great apes  our closest relatives  also show this ability. Then we showed it in dolphins  and then later in elephants. We did this work in my lab with the dolphins and elephants  and it's been recently shown in the magpie. Now  it's interesting  because we've embraced this Darwinian view of a continuity in physical evolution  this physical continuity. But we've been much more reticent  much slower at recognizing this continuity in cognition  in emotion  in consciousness in other animals. Other animals are conscious. They're emotional. They're aware. There have been multitudes of studies with many species over the years that have given us exquisite evidence for thinking and consciousness in other animals  other animals that are quite different than we are in form. We are not alone. We are not alone in these abilities. And I hope  and one of my biggest dreams  is that  with our growing awareness about the consciousness of others and our relationship with the rest of the animal world  that we'll give them the respect and protection that they deserve. So that's a wish I'm throwing out here for everybody  and I hope I can really engage you in this idea. Now  I want to return to dolphins  because these are the animals that I feel like I've been working up closely and personal with for over    years. And these are real personalities. They are not persons  but they're personalities in every sense of the word. And you can't get more alien than the dolphin. They are very different from us in body form. They're radically different. They come from a radically different environment. In fact  we're separated by    million years of divergent evolution. Look at this body. And in every sense of making a pun here  these are true non terrestrials. I wondered how we might interface with these animals. In the     s  I developed an underwater keyboard. This was a custom made touch screen keyboard. What I wanted to do was give the dolphins choice and control. These are big brains  highly social animals  and I thought  well  if we give them choice and control  if they can hit a symbol on this keyboard    and by the way  it was interfaced by fiber optic cables from Hewlett Packard with an Apple II computer. This seems prehistoric now  but this was where we were with technology. So the dolphins could hit a key  a symbol  they heard a computer generated whistle  and they got an object or activity. Now here's a little video. This is Delphi and Pan  and you're going to see Delphi hitting a key  he hears a computer generated whistle     Whistle     and gets a ball  so they can actually ask for things they want. What was remarkable is  they explored this keyboard on their own. There was no intervention on our part. They explored the keyboard. They played around with it. They figured out how it worked. And they started to quickly imitate the sounds they were hearing on the keyboard. They imitated on their own. Beyond that  though  they started learning associations between the symbols  the sounds and the objects. What we saw was self organized learning  and now I'm imagining  what can we do with new technologies  How can we create interfaces  new windows into the minds of animals  with the technologies that exist today  So I was thinking about this  and then  one day  I got a call from Peter. Peter Gabriel  I make noises for a living. On a good day  it's music  and I want to talk a little bit about the most amazing music making experience I ever had. I'm a farm boy. I grew up surrounded by animals  and I would look in these eyes and wonder what was going on there  So as an adult  when I started to read about the amazing breakthroughs with Penny Patterson and Koko  with Sue Savage Rumbaugh and Kanzi  Panbanisha  Irene Pepperberg  Alex the parrot  I got all excited. What was amazing to me also was they seemed a lot more adept at getting a handle on our language than we were on getting a handle on theirs. I work with a lot of musicians from around the world  and often we don't have any common language at all  but we sit down behind our instruments  and suddenly there's a way for us to connect and emote. So I started cold calling  and eventually got through to Sue Savage Rumbaugh  and she invited me down. I went down  and the bonobos had had access to percussion instruments  musical toys  but never before to a keyboard. At first they did what infants do  just bashed it with their fists  and then I asked  through Sue  if Panbanisha could try with one finger only. Sue Savage Rumbaugh  Can you play a grooming song  I want to hear a grooming song. Play a real quiet grooming song. PG  So groom was the subject of the piece. So I'm just behind  jamming  yeah  this is what we started with. Sue's encouraging her to continue a little more. She discovers a note she likes  finds the octave. She'd never sat at a keyboard before. Nice triplets. SSR  You did good. That was very good. PG  She hit good. So that night  we began to dream  and we thought  perhaps the most amazing tool that man's created is the Internet  and what would happen if we could somehow find new interfaces  visual audio interfaces that would allow these remarkable sentient beings that we share the planet with access  And Sue Savage Rumbaugh got excited about that  called her friend Steve Woodruff  and we began hustling all sorts of people whose work related or was inspiring  which led us to Diana  and led us to Neil. Neil Gershenfeld  Thanks  Peter. PG  Thank you. NG  So Peter approached me. I lost it when I saw that clip. He approached me with a vision of doing these things not for people  for animals. And then I was struck in the history of the Internet. This is what the Internet looked like when it was born and you can call that the Internet of middle aged white men  mostly middle aged white men. Vint Cerf   Laughs  NG  Speaking as one. Then  when I first came to TED  which was where I met Peter  I showed this. This is a    web server  and at the time that was radical. And the possibility of making a web server for a dollar grew into what became known as the Internet of Things  which is literally an industry now with tremendous implications for health care  energy efficiency. And we were happy with ourselves. And then when Peter showed me that  I realized we had missed something  which is the rest of the planet. So we started up this interspecies Internet project. Now we started talking with TED about how you bring dolphins and great apes and elephants to TED  and we realized that wouldn't work. So we're going to bring you to them. So if we could switch to the audio from this computer  we've been video conferencing with cognitive animals  and we're going to have each of them just briefly introduce them. And so if we could also have this up  great. So the first site we're going to meet is Cameron Park Zoo in Waco  with orangutans. In the daytime they live outside. It's nighttime there now. So can you please go ahead  Terri Cox  Hi  I'm Terri Cox with the Cameron Park Zoo in Waco  Texas  and with me I have KeraJaan and Mei  two of our Bornean orangutans. During the day  they have a beautiful  large outdoor habitat  and at night  they come into this habitat  into their night quarters  where they can have a climate controlled and secure environment to sleep in. We participate in the Apps for Apes program Orangutan Outreach  and we use iPads to help stimulate and enrich the animals  and also help raise awareness for these critically endangered animals. And they share    percent of our DNA and are incredibly intelligent  so it's so exciting to think of all the opportunities that we have via technology and the Internet to really enrich their lives and open up their world. We're really excited about the possibility of an interspecies Internet  and K.J. has been enjoying the conference very much. NG  That's great. When we were rehearsing last night  he had fun watching the elephants. Next user group are the dolphins at the National Aquarium. Please go ahead. Allison Ginsburg  Good evening. Well  my name is Allison Ginsburg  and we're live in Baltimore at the National Aquarium. Joining me are three of our eight Atlantic bottlenose dolphins     year old Chesapeake  who was our first dolphin born here  her four year old daughter Bayley  and her half sister     year old Maya. Now  here at the National Aquarium we are committed to excellence in animal care  to research  and to conservation. The dolphins are pretty intrigued as to what's going on here tonight. They're not really used to having cameras here at   o'clock at night. In addition  we are very committed to doing different types of research. As Diana mentioned  our animals are involved in many different research studies. NG  Those are for you. Okay  that's great  thank you. And the third user group  in Thailand  is Think Elephants. Go ahead  Josh. Josh Plotnik  Hi  my name is Josh Plotnik  and I'm with Think Elephants International  and we're here in the Golden Triangle of Thailand with the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation elephants. And we have    elephants here  and our research is focused on the evolution of intelligence with elephants  but our foundation Think Elephants is focused on bringing elephants into classrooms around the world virtually like this and showing people how incredible these animals are. So we're able to bring the camera right up to the elephant  put food into the elephant's mouth  show people what's going on inside their mouths  and show everyone around the world how incredible these animals really are. NG  Okay  that's great. Thanks Josh. And once again  we've been building great relationships among them just since we've been rehearsing. So at that point  if we can go back to the other computer  we were starting to think about how you integrate the rest of the biomass of the planet into the Internet  and we went to the best possible person I can think of  which is Vint Cerf  who is one of the founders who gave us the Internet. Vint  VC  Thank you  Neil. A long time ago in a galaxy   oops  wrong script. Forty years ago  Bob Kahn and I did the design of the Internet. Thirty years ago  we turned it on. Just last year  we turned on the production Internet. You've been using the experimental version for the last    years. The production version  it uses IP version  . It has  .  times    to the   th possible terminations. That's a number only that Congress can appreciate. But it leads to what is coming next. When Bob and I did this design  we thought we were building a system to connect computers together. What we very quickly discovered is that this was a system for connecting people together. And what you've seen tonight tells you that we should not restrict this network to one species  that these other intelligent  sentient species should be part of the system too. This is the system as it looks today  by the way. This is what the Internet looks like to a computer that's trying to figure out where the traffic is supposed to go. This is generated by a program that's looking at the connectivity of the Internet  and how all the various networks are connected together. There are about         networks  interconnected  run independently by         different operating agencies  and the only reason this works is that they all use the same standard TCP IP protocols. Well  you know where this is headed. The Internet of Things tell us that a lot of computer enabled appliances and devices are going to become part of this system too  appliances that you use around the house  that you use in your office  that you carry around with yourself or in the car. That's the Internet of Things that's coming. Now  what's important about what these people are doing is that they're beginning to learn how to communicate with species that are not us but share a common sensory environment. We're beginning to explore what it means to communicate with something that isn't just another person. Well  you can see what's coming next. All kinds of possible sentient beings may be interconnected through this system  and I can't wait to see these experiments unfold. What happens after that  Well  let's see. There are machines that need to talk to machines and that we need to talk to  and so as time goes on  we're going to have to learn how to communicate with computers and how to get computers to communicate with us in the way that we're accustomed to  not with keyboards  not with mice  but with speech and gestures and all the natural human language that we're accustomed to. So we'll need something like C PO to become a translator between ourselves and some of the other machines we live with. Now  there is a project that's underway called the interplanetary Internet. It's in operation between Earth and Mars. It's operating on the International Space Station. It's part of the spacecraft that's in orbit around the Sun that's rendezvoused with two planets. So the interplanetary system is on its way  but there's a last project  which the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency  which funded the original ARPANET  funded the Internet  funded the interplanetary architecture  is now funding a project to design a spacecraft to get to the nearest star in     years' time. What that means is that what we're learning with these interactions with other species will teach us  ultimately  how we might interact with an alien from another world. I can hardly wait. June Cohen  So first of all  thank you  and I would like to acknowledge that four people who could talk to us for full four days actually managed to stay to four minutes each  and we thank you for that. I have so many questions  but maybe a few practical things that the audience might want to know. You're launching this idea here at TED   PG  Today. JC  Today. This is the first time you're talking about it. Tell me a little bit about where you're going to take the idea. What's next  PG  I think we want to engage as many people here as possible in helping us think of smart interfaces that will make all this possible. NG  And just mechanically  there's a     c     and web infrastructure and all of that  but it's not quite ready to turn on  so we'll roll that out  and contact us if you want the information on it. The idea is this will be    much like the Internet functions as a network of networks  which is Vint's core contribution  this will be a wrapper around all of these initiatives  that are wonderful individually  to link them globally. JC  Right  and do you have a web address that we might look for yet  NG  Shortly. JC  Shortly. We will come back to you on that. And very quickly  just to clarify. Some people might have looked at the video that you showed and thought  well  that's just a webcam. What's special about it  If you could talk for just a moment about how you want to go past that  NG  So this is scalable video infrastructure  not for a few to a few but many to many  so that it scales to symmetrical video sharing and content sharing across these sites around the planet. So there's a lot of back end signal processing  not for one to many  but for many to many. JC  Right  and then on a practical level  which technologies are you looking at first  I know you mentioned that a keyboard is a really key part of this. DR  We're trying to develop an interactive touch screen for dolphins. This is sort of a continuation of some of the earlier work  and we just got our first seed money today towards that  so it's our first project. JC  Before the talk  even. DR  Yeah. JC  Wow. Well done. All right  well thank you all so much for joining us. It's such a delight to have you on the stage. DR  Thank you.

diebedo_francis_kere_how_to_build_with_clay_and_community,600,602,Diébédo Francis Kéré 2013,Diébédo Francis Kéré,male,How to build with clay ... and community,Dec 2013,717,I would like to show you how architecture has helped to change the life of my community and has opened opportunities to hope. I am a native of Burkina Faso. According to the World Bank  Burkina Faso is one of the poorest countries in the world  but what does it look like to grow up in a place like that  I am an example of that. I was born in a little village called Gando. In Gando  there was no electricity  no access to clean drinking water  and no school. But my father wanted me to learn how to read and write. For this reason  I had to leave my family when I was seven and to stay in a city far away from my village with no contact with my family. In this place I sat in a class like that with more than     other kids  and for six years. In this time  it just happened to me to come to school to realize that my classmate died. Today  not so much has changed. There is still no electricity in my village. People still are dying in Burkina Faso  and access to clean drinking water is still a big problem. I had luck. I was lucky  because this is a fact of life when you grow up in a place like that. But I was lucky. I had a scholarship. I could go to Germany to study. So now  I suppose  I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege it is for me to be standing before you today. From Gando  my home village in Burkina Faso  to Berlin in Germany to become an architect is a big  big step. But what to do with this privilege  Since I was a student  I wanted to open up better opportunities to other kids in Gando. I just wanted to use my skills and build a school. But how do you do it when you're still a student and you don't have money  Oh yes  I started to make drawings and asked for money. Fundraising was not an easy task. I even asked my classmates to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes  but to sponsor my school project. In real wonder  two years later  I was able to collect        U.S. dollars. When I came home to Gando to bring the good news  my people were over the moon  but when they realized that I was planning to use clay  they were shocked.  A clay building is not able to stand a rainy season  and Francis wants us to use it and build a school. Is this the reason why he spent so much time in Europe studying instead of working in the field with us   My people build all the time with clay  but they don't see any innovation with mud. So I had to convince everybody. I started to speak with the community  and I could convince everybody  and we could start to work. And the women  the men  everybody from the village  was part of this building process. I was allowed to use even traditional techniques. So clay floor for example  the young men come and stand like that  beating  hours for hours  and then their mothers came  and they are beating in this position  for hours  giving water and beating. And then the polishers come. They start polishing it with a stone for hours. And then you have this result  very fine  like a baby bottom. It's not photoshopped.  Laughter  This is the school  built with the community. The walls are totally made out of compressed clay blocks from Gando. The roof structure is made with cheap steel bars normally hiding inside concrete. And the classroom  the ceiling is made out of both of them used together. In this school  there was a simple idea  to create comfort in a classroom. Don't forget  it can be    degrees in Burkina Faso  so with simple ventilation  I wanted to make the classroom good for teaching and learning. And this is the project today     years old  still in best condition. And the kids  they love it. And for me and my community  this project was a huge success. It has opened up opportunities to do more projects in Gando. So I could do a lot of projects  and here I am going to share with you only three of them. The first one is the school extension  of course. How do you explain drawings and engineering to people who are neither able to read nor write  I started to build a prototype like that. The innovation was to build a clay vault. So then  I jumped on the top like that  with my team  and it works. The community is looking. It still works. So we can build.  Laughter  And we kept building  and that is the result. The kids are happy  and they love it. The community is very proud. We made it. And even animals  like these donkeys  love our buildings. The next project is the library in Gando. And see now  we tried to introduce different ideas in our buildings  but we often don't have so much material. Something we have in Gando are clay pots. We wanted to use them to create openings. So we just bring them like you can see to the building site. we start cutting them  and then we place them on top of the roof before we pour the concrete  and you have this result. The openings are letting the hot air out and light in. Very simple. My most recent project in Gando is a high school project. I would like to share with you this. The innovation in this project is to cast mud like you cast concrete. How do you cast mud  We start making a lot of mortars  like you can see  and when everything is ready  when you know what is the best recipe and the best form  you start working with the community. And sometimes I can leave. They will do it themselves. I came to speak to you like that. Another factor in Gando is rain. When the rains come  we hurry up to protect our fragile walls against the rain. Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne Claude. It is simply how we protect our walls. The rain in Burkina comes very fast  and after that  you have floods everywhere in the country. But for us  the rain is good. It brings sand and gravel to the river we need to use to build. We just wait for the rain to go. We take the sand  we mix it with clay  and we keep building. That is it. The Gando project was always connected to training the people  because I just wanted  one day when I fall down and die  that at least one person from Gando keeps doing this work. But you will be surprised. I'm still alive. And my people now can use their skills to earn money themselves. Usually  for a young man from Gando to earn money  you have to leave the country to the city  sometimes leave the country and some never come back  making the community weaker. But now they can stay in the country and work on different building sites and earn money to feed their family. There's a new quality in this work. Yes  you know it. I have won a lot of awards through this work. For sure  it has opened opportunities. I have become myself known. But the reason why I do what I do is my community. When I was a kid  I was going to school  I was coming back every holiday to Gando. By the end of every holidays  I had to say goodbye to the community  going from one compound to another one. All women in Gando will open their clothes like that and give me the last penny. In my culture  this is a symbol of deep affection. As a seven year old guy  I was impressed. I just asked my mother one day   Why do all these women love me so much   She just answered   They are contributing to pay for your education hoping that you will be successful and one day come back and help improve the quality of life of the community.  I hope now that I was able to make my community proud through this work  and I hope I was able to prove you the power of community  and to show you that architecture can be inspiring for communities to shape their own future. Merci beaucoup.  Applause  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Applause ,nan,201312,6.33282051282,918097,TEDCity2.0,2013-09-20,20130920
a_whistleblower_you_haven_t_heard,1891,1893,Geert Chatrou 2011,Geert Chatrou,male,A whistleblower you haven't heard,Feb 2011,708,Thank you. Thank you very much. That was whistling. I'm trying to do this in English. What is a chubby  curly haired guy from Holland    why is he whistling  Well actually  I've  been  whistling since the age of four  about four. My dad was always whistling around the house  and I just thought that's part of communication in my family. So I whistled along with him. And actually  till I was     I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling  because  to be honest  my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior. I whistled alone. I whistled in the classroom. I whistled on  my  bike. I whistled everywhere. And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family in law. And they had some  in my opinion  terrible Christmas music. And when I hear music that I don't like  I try to make it better. So  Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer     you know it  But it can also sound like this. But during a Christmas party    at dinner actually    it's very annoying. So my sister in law asked me a few times   Please stop whistling.  And I just couldn't. And at one point    and I had some wine  I have to admit that    at one point I said   If there was a contest  I would join.  And two weeks later I received a text message   You're going to America.  So  okay  I'm going to America. I would love to  but why  So I immediately called her up  of course. She Googled  and she found this World Whistling Championship in America  of course. She didn't expect me to go there. And I would have lost my face. I don't know if that's correct English. But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean. I lost my face. And she thought   He will never go there.  But actually I did. So I went to Louisburg  North Carolina  southeast United States  and I entered the world of whistling. And I also entered the world championship  and I won there in     . That was great fun  of course. And to defend my title    like judokas do and sportsmen    I thought  well let's go back in       and I won again. Then I couldn't participate for a few years. And in      I entered again in Japan  Tokyo  and I won again. So what happened now is I'm standing here in Rotterdam  in the beautiful city  on a big stage  and I'm talking about whistling. And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment. So I quit my day job as a nurse. And I try to live my dream    well  actually  it was never my dream  but it sounds so good. Okay  I'm not the only one whistling here. You say   Huh  what do you mean   Well actually  you are going to whistle along. And then always the same thing happens  people are watching each other and think   Oh  my God. Why  Can I go away   No  you can't. Actually it's very simple. The track that I will whistle is called  F te de la Belle.  It's about    minutes long. No  no  no. It's four minutes long. And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling. So I whistle the tone. Sorry. I forgot one thing. You whistle the same tone as me. I heard a wide variety of tones. This is very promising. This is very promising. I'll ask the technicians to start the music. And if it's started  I just point where you whistle along  and we will see what happens. Oh  hah. I'm so sorry  technicians. I'm so used to that. I start it myself. Okay  here it is. Okay. It's easy  isn't it  Now comes the solo. I propose I do that myself. Max Westerman  Geert Chatrou  the World Champion  of  Whistling.

haas_hahn_how_painting_can_transform_communities,844,846,Haas&Hahn 2014,Haas&Hahn,they (male and male),How painting can transform communities,Nov 2014,678,Dre Urhahn  This theater  is built on Copacabana  which is the most famous  beach in the world  but    kilometers away from here in the North Zone of Rio lies a community called Vila Cruzeiro  and roughly        people live there. Now  the people here in Rio mostly know Vila Cruzeiro from the news  and unfortunately  news  from Vila Cruzeiro often is not good news. But Vila Cruzeiro is also the place where our story begins. Jeroen Koolhaas  Ten years  ago  we first came to Rio to shoot a documentary  about life in the favelas. Now  we learned that favelas  are informal communities. They emerged over the years when immigrants from the countryside came to the cities looking for work  like cities within the cities  known for problems like crime  poverty  and the violent drug war between police and the drug gangs. So what struck us was that these were communities that the people who lived there had built  with their own hands  without a master plan and like a giant work in progress. Where we're from  in Holland  everything is planned. We even have rules for  how to follow the rules. DU  So the last day of  filming  we ended up in Vila Cruzeiro  and  we were sitting down and we had a drink  and we were overlooking this hill with all these houses  and most of these houses looked unfinished  and they had walls of bare brick  but we saw some of these houses which were plastered and painted  and suddenly we had this idea  what would it look like if all these houses would be plastered and painted  And then we imagined one big design  one big work of art. Who would expect something like that in a place like this  So we thought  would that even be possible  So first we started to count the houses  but we soon lost count. But somehow the idea stuck. JK  We had a friend. He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro. His name was Nanko  and he also liked the idea. He said   You know  everybody here would pretty much love  to have their houses plastered and painted. It's when a house is finished.  So he introduced us to the right people  and Vitor and Maurinho became our crew. We picked three houses in the center of the community and we start here. We made a few designs  and everybody liked this design of a boy flying a kite the best. So we started painting   and the first thing we did was to paint everything blue  and we thought that looked  already pretty good. But they hated it. The people who lived there really hated it. They said   What did you do  You painted our house in  exactly the same color as the police station.  In a favela  that is not a good thing. Also the same color as the prison cell. So we quickly went ahead  and we painted the boy  and then we thought we were finished  we were really happy  but still  it wasn't good because the little kids started coming up to us  and they said   You know   there's a boy flying the kite  but where is his kite   We said   Uh  it's art. You know  you have to imagine the kite.  And they said   No  no  no   we want to see the kite.  So we quickly installed a kite way up high on the hill  so that you could see  the boy flying the kite and you could actually see a kite. So the local news started writing about it  which was great  and then even The Guardian wrote about it   Notorious slum becomes open air gallery.  JK  So  encouraged by this success  we went back to Rio for a second project  and we stumbled upon this street. It was covered in concrete  to prevent mudslides  and somehow we saw a sort of river in it  and we imagined this river to be a river in Japanese style with koi carp swimming upstream. So we decided to paint that river  and we invited Rob Admiraal  who is a tattoo artist  and he specialized in the Japanese style. So little did we know that we would spend almost an entire year painting that river  together with Geovani and Robinho and Vitor  who lived nearby. And we even moved into the neighborhood when one of the guys that  lived on the street  Elias  told us that we could come  and live in his house  together with his family  which was fantastic. Unfortunately  during that time  another war broke out between the police and the drug gangs. We learned that during those times  people in communities  really stick together during these times of hardship  but we also learned a  very important element  the importance of barbecues.   Laughter  Because  when you throw a barbecue  it turns you from a guest into a host  so we decided to throw one almost every other week  and we got to know everybody  in the neighborhood. JK  We still had this  idea of the hill  though. DU  Yeah  yeah  we were talking about the scale of this  because this painting was incredibly big  and it was insanely detailed  and this process almost drove us completely insane ourselves. But we figured that maybe   during this process  all the time that we had  spent in the neighborhood was maybe actually even more important than the painting itself. JK  So after all that time  this hill  this idea was still there  and we started to make sketches  models  and we figured something out. We figured that our ideas  our designs had to be a little bit more simple than that last project so that we could paint with more people and cover more houses at the same time. And we had an opportunity to try that out in a community in the central part of Rio  which is called Santa Marta  and we made a design for this place which looked like this  and then we got people to go along with it because turns out that if  your idea is ridiculously big  it's easier to get people to  go along with this.  Laughter  And the people of Santa Marta got together and in a little over a month they turned that square into this. And this image somehow  went all over the world. DU  So then we received  an unexpected phone call from the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program  and they had this question if this idea  our approach  if this would actually  work in North Philly  which is one of the poorest neighborhoods in the United States. So we immediately said yes. We had no idea how  but it seemed like a very  interesting challenge  so we did exactly the  same as we did in Rio  and we moved into the neighborhood and started barbecuing. So the project took almost two years to complete  and we made individual designs for every single house on  the avenue that we painted  and we made these designs together with the local store owners   the building owners  and a team of about a dozen  young men and women. They were hired  and then they were trained as painters  and together they transformed their own neighborhood  the whole street  into a  giant patchwork of color. And at the end  the city of Philadelphia thanked every single one of them and gave them a merit for their accomplishment. JK  So now we had painted a whole street. How about we do this whole hill now  We started looking for funding  but instead  we just ran into questions  like  how many houses  are you going to paint  How many square meters is that  How much paint are you going to use  and how many people are you going to employ  And we did try for years to write plans for the funding and answer  all those questions  but then we thought  in order to answer all those questions  you have to know exactly  what you're going to do before you actually get there and start. And maybe it's a mistake  to think like that. It would lose some of the  magic that we had learned about that if you go somewhere and you spend time there  you can let the project grow organically and have a life of its own. DU  So what we did is we decided to take this  plan and strip it away from all the numbers and all the ideas and presumptions and just go back to the base idea  which was to transform this hill into a giant work of art. And instead of looking for funding  we started a crowdfunding campaign  and in a little over a month  more than       people put together and donated over         dollars. So for us  this was an amazing  moment  because now   because now we finally had the freedom to use all the lessons that we had learned and create a project that was built the same way that the favela was built  from the ground on up  bottom up  with no master plan. JK  So we went back   and we employed Angelo  and he's a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro  very talented guy  and he knows almost everybody there  and then we employed Elias  our former landlord who invited us into his house  and he's a master of construction. Together with them  we decided where to start. We picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro  and houses are being plastered as we speak. And the good thing about them is that they are deciding which houses go next. They're even printing t shirts  they're putting up banners explaining everything to everybody  and talking to the press. This article about Angelo appeared. DU  So while this is happening  we are bringing this  idea all over the world. So  like the project we  did in Philadelphia  we are also invited to do workshops  for instance in Cura ao  and right now we're planning  a huge project in Haiti. JK  So the favela was not only the place where this idea started  it was also the place that made it possible to work without a master plan  because these communities are informal   this was the inspiration   and in a communal effort   together with the people  you can almost work like in an orchestra  where you can have a hundred instruments playing together to create a symphony. DU  So we want to thank everybody who wanted to become part of this dream and supported us along the way  and we are looking at continuing. JK  Yeah. And so one day pretty soon  when the colors start  going up on these walls  we hope more people will join us  and join this big dream  and maybe one day  the  whole of Vila Cruzeiro will be painted.

handpring_puppet_co_the_genius_puppetry_behind_war_horse,1924,1926,Handspring Puppet Co. 2011,Handspring Puppet Co.,male,The genius puppetry behind War Horse,Mar 2011,1074,Adrian Kohler  Well  we're here today to talk about the evolution of a puppet horse. Basil Jones  But actually we're going to start this evolution with a hyena. AK  The ancestor of the horse. Okay  we'll do something with it. Hahahaha. The hyena is the ancestor of the horse because it was part of a production called  Faustus in Africa   a Handspring Production from       where it had to play draughts with Helen of Troy. This production was directed by South African artist and theater director  William Kentridge. So it needed a very articulate front paw. But  like all puppets  it has other attributes. BJ  One of them is breath  and it kind of breathes. AK  Haa haa haaa. BJ  Breath is really important for us. It's the kind of original movement for any puppet for us onstage. It's the thing that distinguishes the puppet    AK  Oops. BJ  From an actor. Puppets always have to try to be alive. It's their kind of ur story onstage  that desperation to live. AK  Yeah  it's basically a dead object  as you can see  and it only lives because you make it. An actor struggles to die onstage  but a puppet has to struggle to live. And in a way that's a metaphor for life. BJ  So every moment it's on the stage  it's making the struggle. So we call this a piece of emotional engineering that uses up to the minute   th century technology    to turn nouns into verbs. AK  Well actually I prefer to say that it's an object constructed out of wood and cloth with movement built into it to persuade you to believe that it has life. BJ  Okay so. AK  It has ears that move passively when the head goes. BJ  And it has these bulkheads made out of plywood  covered with fabric    curiously similar  in fact  to the plywood canoes that Adrian's father used to make when he was a boy in their workshop. AK  In Port Elizabeth  the village outside Port Elizabeth in South Africa. BJ  His mother was a puppeteer. And when we met at art school and fell in love in       I hated puppets. I really thought they were so beneath me. I wanted to become an avant garde artist    and Punch and Judy was certainly not where I wanted to go. And  in fact  it took about    years to discover the Bambara Bamana puppets of Mali in West Africa  where there's a fabulous tradition of puppetry  to learn a renewed  or a new  respect for this art form. AK  So in       I persuaded Basil and some friends of mine to form a puppet company. And    years later  miraculously  we collaborated with a company from Mali  the Sogolon Marionette Troupe of Bamako  where we made a piece about a tall giraffe. It was just called  Tall Horse   which was a life sized giraffe. BJ  And here again  you see the same structure. The bulkheads have now turned into hoops of cane  but it's ultimately the same structure. It's got two people inside it on stilts  which give them the height  and somebody in the front who's using a kind of steering wheel to move that head. AK  The person in the hind legs is also controlling the tail  a bit like the hyena    same mechanism  just a bit bigger. And he's controlling the ear movement. BJ  So this production was seen by Tom Morris of the National Theatre in London. And just around that time  his mother had said   Have you seen this book by Michael Morpurgo called 'War Horse'   AK  It's about a boy who falls in love with a horse. The horse is sold to the First World War  and he joins up to find his horse. BJ  So Tom gave us a call and said   Do you think you could make us a horse for a show to happen at the National Theatre   AK  It seemed a lovely idea. BJ  But it had to ride. It had to have a rider. AK  It had to have a rider  and it had to participate in cavalry charges. A play about early   th century plowing technology and cavalry charges was a little bit of a challenge for the accounting department at the National Theatre in London. But they agreed to go along with it for a while. So we began with a test. BJ  This is Adrian and Thys Stander  who went on to actually design the cane system for the horse  and our next door neighbor Katherine  riding on a ladder. The weight is really difficult when it's up above your head. AK  And once we put Katherine through that particular brand of hell  we knew that we might be able to make a horse  which could be ridden. So we made a model. This is a cardboard model  a little bit smaller than the hyena. You'll notice that the legs are plywood legs and the canoe structure is still there. BJ  And the two manipulators are inside. But we didn't realize at the time that we actually needed a third manipulator  because we couldn't manipulate the neck from inside and walk the horse at the same time. AK  We started work on the prototype after the model was approved  and the prototype took a bit longer than we anticipated. We had to throw out the plywood legs and make new cane ones. And we had a crate built for it. It had to be shipped to London. We were going to test drive it on the street outside of our house in Cape Town  and it got to midnight and we hadn't done that yet. BJ  So we got a camera  and we posed the puppet in various galloping stances. And we sent it off to the National Theatre  hoping that they believed that we created something that worked. AK  A month later  we were there in London with this big box and a studio full of people about to work with us. BJ  About    people. AK  We were terrified. We opened the lid  we took the horse out  and it did work  it walked and it was able to be ridden. Here I have an    second clip of the very first walk of the prototype. This is in the National Theatre studio  the place where they cook new ideas. It had by no means got the green light yet. The choreographer  Toby Sedgwick  invented a beautiful sequence where the baby horse  which was made out of sticks and bits of twigs  grew up into the big horse. And Nick Starr  the director of the National Theatre  saw that particular moment  he was standing next to me    he nearly wet himself. And so the show was given the green light. And we went back to Cape Town and redesigned the horse completely. Here is the plan. And here is our factory in Cape Town where we make horses. You can see quite a lot of skeletons in the background there. The horses are completely handmade. There is very little   th century technology in them. We used a bit of laser cutting on the plywood and some of the aluminum pieces. But because they have to be light and flexible  and each one of them is different  they can't be mass produced  unfortunately. So here are some half finished horses ready to be worked in London. And now we would like to introduce you to Joey. Joey boy  you there  Joey. Joey. Joey  come here. No  no  I haven't got it. He's got it  it's in his pocket. BJ  Joey. AK  Joey  Joey  Joey  Joey. Come here. Stand here where people can see you. Move around. Come on. I'd just like to describe    I won't talk too loud. He might get irritated. Here  Craig is working the head. He has bicycle brake cables going down to the head control in his hand. Each one of them operates either an ear  separately  or the head  up and down. But he also controls the head directly by using his hand. The ears are obviously a very important emotional indicator of the horse. When they point right back  the horse is fearful or angry  depending upon what's going on in front of him  around him. Or  when he's more relaxed  the head comes down and the ears listen  either side. Horses' hearing is very important. It's almost more important than their eyesight. Over here  Tommy's got what you call the heart position. He's working the leg. You see the string tendon from the hyena  the hyena's front leg  automatically pulls the hoop up. Horses are so unpredictable. The way a hoof comes up with a horse immediately gives you the feeling that it's a convincing horse action. The hind legs have got the same action. BJ  And Mikey also has  in his fingers  the ability to move the tail from left to right  and up and down with the other hand. And together  there's quite a complex possibility of tail expression. AK  You want to say something about the breathing  BJ  We had a big challenge with breathing. Adrian thought that he was going to have to split the chest of the puppet in two and make it breathe like that    because that's how a horse would breathe  with an expanded chest. But we realized that  if that were to be happening  you wouldn't  as an audience  see the breath. So he made a channel in here  and the chest moves up and down in that channel. So it's anti naturalistic really  the up and down movement  but it feels like breath. And it's very  very simple because all that happens is that the puppeteer breathes with his knees. AK  Other emotional stuff. If I were to touch the horse here on his skin  the heart puppeteer can shake the body from inside and get the skin to quiver. You'll notice  of course  that the puppet is made out of cane lines. And I would like you to believe that it was an aesthetic choice  that I was making a three dimensional drawing of a horse that somehow moves in space. But of course  it was the cane is light  the cane is flexible  the cane is durable and the cane is moldable. And so it was a very practical reason why it was made of cane. The skin itself is made out of a see through nylon mesh  which  if the lighting designer wants the horse to almost disappear  she can light the background and the horse becomes ghostlike. You see the skeletal structure of it. Or if you light it from above  it becomes more solid. Again  that was a practical consideration. The guys inside the horse have to be able to see out. They have to be able to act along with their fellow actors in the production. And it's very much an in the moment activity that they're engaged in. It's three heads making one character. But now we would like you to put Joey through some paces. And plant. Thank you. And now just    All the way from sunny California we have Zem Joaquin who's going to ride the horse for us. So we would like to stress that the performance you see in the horse is three guys who have studied horse behavior incredibly thoroughly. BJ  Not being able to talk to one another while they're onstage because they're mic'd. The sound that that very large chest makes  of the horse    the whinnying and the nickering and everything    that starts usually with one performer  carries on with a second person and ends with a third.

what_we_learned_from_5_million_books,2044,2046,Jean-Baptiste Michel + Erez Lieberman Aiden 2011,Jean-Baptiste Michel + Erez Lieberman Aiden,male,What we learned from 5 million books,Sep 2011,839,Erez Lieberman Aiden  Everyone knows that a picture is worth a thousand words. But we at Harvard were wondering if this was really true. So we assembled a team of experts  spanning Harvard  MIT  The American Heritage Dictionary  The Encyclopedia Britannica and even our proud sponsors  the Google. And we cogitated about this for about four years. And we came to a startling conclusion. Ladies and gentlemen  a picture is not worth a thousand words. In fact  we found some pictures that are worth     billion words. Jean Baptiste Michel  So how did we get to this conclusion  So Erez and I were thinking about ways to get a big picture of human culture and human history  change over time. So many books actually have been written over the years. So we were thinking  well the best way to learn from them is to read all of these millions of books. Now of course  if there's a scale for how awesome that is  that has to rank extremely  extremely high. Now the problem is there's an X axis for that  which is the practical axis. This is very  very low. Now people tend to use an alternative approach  which is to take a few sources and read them very carefully. This is extremely practical  but not so awesome. What you really want to do is to get to the awesome yet practical part of this space. So it turns out there was a company across the river called Google who had started a digitization project a few years back that might just enable this approach. They have digitized millions of books. So what that means is  one could use computational methods to read all of the books in a click of a button. That's very practical and extremely awesome. ELA  Let me tell you a little bit about where books come from. Since time immemorial  there have been authors. These authors have been striving to write books. And this became considerably easier with the development of the printing press some centuries ago. Since then  the authors have won on     million distinct occasions  publishing books. Now if those books are not lost to history  then they are somewhere in a library  and many of those books have been getting retrieved from the libraries and digitized by Google  which has scanned    million books to date. Now when Google digitizes a book  they put it into a really nice format. Now we've got the data  plus we have metadata. We have information about things like where was it published  who was the author  when was it published. And what we do is go through all of those records and exclude everything that's not the highest quality data. What we're left with is a collection of five million books      billion words  a string of characters a thousand times longer than the human genome    a text which  when written out  would stretch from here to the Moon and back    times over    a veritable shard of our cultural genome. Of course what we did when faced with such outrageous hyperbole ... was what any self respecting researchers would have done. We took a page out of XKCD  and we said   Stand back. We're going to try science.  JM  Now of course  we were thinking  well let's just first put the data out there for people to do science to it. Now we're thinking  what data can we release  Well of course  you want to take the books and release the full text of these five million books. Now Google  and Jon Orwant in particular  told us a little equation that we should learn. So you have five million  that is  five million authors and five million plaintiffs is a massive lawsuit. So  although that would be really  really awesome  again  that's extremely  extremely impractical. Now again  we kind of caved in  and we did the very practical approach  which was a bit less awesome. We said  well instead of releasing the full text  we're going to release statistics about the books. So take for instance  A gleam of happiness.  It's four words  we call that a four gram. We're going to tell you how many times a particular four gram appeared in books in                   all the way up to     . That gives us a time series of how frequently this particular sentence was used over time. We do that for all the words and phrases that appear in those books  and that gives us a big table of two billion lines that tell us about the way culture has been changing. ELA  So those two billion lines  we call them two billion n grams. What do they tell us  Well the individual n grams measure cultural trends. Let me give you an example. Let's suppose that I am thriving  then tomorrow I want to tell you about how well I did. And so I might say   Yesterday  I throve.  Alternatively  I could say   Yesterday  I thrived.  Well which one should I use  How to know  As of about six months ago  the state of the art in this field is that you would  for instance  go up to the following psychologist with fabulous hair  and you'd say   Steve  you're an expert on the irregular verbs. What should I do   And he'd tell you   Well most people say thrived  but some people say throve.  And you also knew  more or less  that if you were to go back in time     years and ask the following statesman with equally fabulous hair   Tom  what should I say   He'd say   Well  in my day  most people throve  but some thrived.  So now what I'm just going to show you is raw data. Two rows from this table of two billion entries. What you're seeing is year by year frequency of  thrived  and  throve  over time. Now this is just two out of two billion rows. So the entire data set is a billion times more awesome than this slide. JM  Now there are many other pictures that are worth     billion words. For instance  this one. If you just take influenza  you will see peaks at the time where you knew big flu epidemics were killing people around the globe. ELA  If you were not yet convinced  sea levels are rising  so is atmospheric CO  and global temperature. JM  You might also want to have a look at this particular n gram  and that's to tell Nietzsche that God is not dead  although you might agree that he might need a better publicist. ELA  You can get at some pretty abstract concepts with this sort of thing. For instance  let me tell you the history of the year     . Pretty much for the vast majority of history  no one gave a damn about     . In       in       in       no one cared. Through the   s and   s  no one cared. Suddenly  in the mid   s  there started to be a buzz. People realized that      was going to happen  and it could be big. But nothing got people interested in      like the year     . People were walking around obsessed. They couldn't stop talking about all the things they did in       all the things they were planning to do in       all the dreams of what they wanted to accomplish in     . In fact       was so fascinating that for years thereafter  people just kept talking about all the amazing things that happened  in '    '    '  . Finally in       someone woke up and realized that      had gotten somewhat pass . And just like that  the bubble burst. And the story of      is the story of every year that we have on record  with a little twist  because now we've got these nice charts. And because we have these nice charts  we can measure things. We can say   Well how fast does the bubble burst   And it turns out that we can measure that very precisely. Equations were derived  graphs were produced  and the net result is that we find that the bubble bursts faster and faster with each passing year. We are losing interest in the past more rapidly. JM  Now a little piece of career advice. So for those of you who seek to be famous  we can learn from the    most famous political figures  authors  actors and so on. So if you want to become famous early on  you should be an actor  because then fame starts rising by the end of your   s    you're still young  it's really great. Now if you can wait a little bit  you should be an author  because then you rise to very great heights  like Mark Twain  for instance  extremely famous. But if you want to reach the very top  you should delay gratification and  of course  become a politician. So here you will become famous by the end of your   s  and become very  very famous afterward. So scientists also tend to get famous when they're much older. Like for instance  biologists and physics tend to be almost as famous as actors. One mistake you should not do is become a mathematician. If you do that  you might think   Oh great. I'm going to do my best work when I'm in my   s.  But guess what  nobody will really care. ELA  There are more sobering notes among the n grams. For instance  here's the trajectory of Marc Chagall  an artist born in     . And this looks like the normal trajectory of a famous person. He gets more and more and more famous  except if you look in German. If you look in German  you see something completely bizarre  something you pretty much never see  which is he becomes extremely famous and then all of a sudden plummets  going through a nadir between      and       before rebounding afterward. And of course  what we're seeing is the fact Marc Chagall was a Jewish artist in Nazi Germany. Now these signals are actually so strong that we don't need to know that someone was censored. We can actually figure it out using really basic signal processing. Here's a simple way to do it. Well  a reasonable expectation is that somebody's fame in a given period of time should be roughly the average of their fame before and their fame after. So that's sort of what we expect. And we compare that to the fame that we observe. And we just divide one by the other to produce something we call a suppression index. If the suppression index is very  very  very small  then you very well might be being suppressed. If it's very large  maybe you're benefiting from propaganda. JM  Now you can actually look at the distribution of suppression indexes over whole populations. So for instance  here    this suppression index is for       people picked in English books where there's no known suppression    it would be like this  basically tightly centered on one. What you expect is basically what you observe. This is distribution as seen in Germany    very different  it's shifted to the left. People talked about it twice less as it should have been. But much more importantly  the distribution is much wider. There are many people who end up on the far left on this distribution who are talked about    times fewer than they should have been. But then also many people on the far right who seem to benefit from propaganda. This picture is the hallmark of censorship in the book record. ELA  So culturomics is what we call this method. It's kind of like genomics. Except genomics is a lens on biology through the window of the sequence of bases in the human genome. Culturomics is similar. It's the application of massive scale data collection analysis to the study of human culture. Here  instead of through the lens of a genome  through the lens of digitized pieces of the historical record. The great thing about culturomics is that everyone can do it. Why can everyone do it  Everyone can do it because three guys  Jon Orwant  Matt Gray and Will Brockman over at Google  saw the prototype of the Ngram Viewer  and they said   This is so fun. We have to make this available for people.  So in two weeks flat    the two weeks before our paper came out    they coded up a version of the Ngram Viewer for the general public. And so you too can type in any word or phrase that you're interested in and see its n gram immediately    also browse examples of all the various books in which your n gram appears. JM  Now this was used over a million times on the first day  and this is really the best of all the queries. So people want to be their best  put their best foot forward. But it turns out in the   th century  people didn't really care about that at all. They didn't want to be their best  they wanted to be their beft. So what happened is  of course  this is just a mistake. It's not that strove for mediocrity  it's just that the S used to be written differently  kind of like an F. Now of course  Google didn't pick this up at the time  so we reported this in the science article that we wrote. But it turns out this is just a reminder that  although this is a lot of fun  when you interpret these graphs  you have to be very careful  and you have to adopt the base standards in the sciences. ELA  People have been using this for all kinds of fun purposes. Actually  we're not going to have to talk  we're just going to show you all the slides and remain silent. This person was interested in the history of frustration. There's various types of frustration. If you stub your toe  that's a one A  argh.  If the planet Earth is annihilated by the Vogons to make room for an interstellar bypass  that's an eight A  aaaaaaaargh.  This person studies all the  arghs   from one through eight A's. And it turns out that the less frequent  arghs  are  of course  the ones that correspond to things that are more frustrating    except  oddly  in the early   s. We think that might have something to do with Reagan. JM  There are many usages of this data  but the bottom line is that the historical record is being digitized. Google has started to digitize    million books. That's    percent of all the books that have ever been published. It's a sizable chunk of human culture. There's much more in culture  there's manuscripts  there newspapers  there's things that are not text  like art and paintings. These all happen to be on our computers  on computers across the world. And when that happens  that will transform the way we have to understand our past  our present and human culture. Thank you very much.,nan,201109,6.3148312611,1816138,TEDxBoston 2011,2011-07-24,20110724
jeff_speck_the_walkable_city,557,559,Jeff Speck 2013,Jeff Speck,male,The walkable city,Oct 2013,1003,So I'm a city planner  an urban designer  former arts advocate  trained in architecture and art history  and I want to talk to you today not about design but about America and how America can be more economically resilient  how America can be healthier  and how America can be more environmentally sustainable. And I realize this is a global forum  but I think I need to talk about America because there is a history  in some places  not all  of American ideas being appropriated  being emulated  for better or for worse  around the world. And the worst idea we've ever had is suburban sprawl. It's being emulated in many places as we speak. By suburban sprawl  I refer to the reorganization of the landscape and the creation of the landscape around the requirement of automobile use  and that the automobile that was once an instrument of freedom has become a gas belching  time wasting and life threatening prosthetic device that many of us need just to  most Americans  in fact  need  just to live their daily lives. And there's an alternative. You know  we say  half the world is living in cities. Well  in America  that living in cities  for many of them  they're living in cities still where they're dependent on that automobile. And what I work for  and to do  is to make our cities more walkable. But I can't give design arguments for that that will have as much impact as the arguments that I've learned from the economists  the epidemiologists and the environmentalists. So these are the three arguments that I'm going to give you quickly today. When I was growing up in the '  s  the typical American spent one tenth of their income  American family  on transportation. Since then  we've doubled the number of roads in America  and we now spend one fifth of our income on transportation. Working families  which are defined as earning between        and        dollars a year in America are spending more now on transportation than on housing  slightly more  because of this phenomenon called  drive till you qualify   finding homes further and further and further from the city centers and from their jobs  so that they're locked in this  two  three hours  four hours a day of commuting. And these are the neighborhoods  for example  in the Central Valley of California that weren't hurt when the housing bubble burst and when the price of gas went up  they were decimated. And in fact  these are many of the half vacant communities that you see today. Imagine putting everything you have into your mortgage  it goes underwater  and you have to pay twice as much for all the driving that you're doing. So we know what it's done to our society and all the extra work we have to do to support our cars. What happens when a city decides it's going to set other priorities  And probably the best example we have here in America is Portland  Oregon. Portland made a bunch of decisions in the     s that began to distinguish it from almost every other American city. While most other cities were growing an undifferentiated spare tire of sprawl  they instituted an urban growth boundary. While most cities were reaming out their roads  removing parallel parking and trees in order to flow more traffic  they instituted a skinny streets program. And while most cities were investing in more roads and more highways  they actually invested in bicycling and in walking. And they spent    million dollars on bike facilities  which seems like a lot of money  but it was spent over about    years  so two million dollars a year    not that much    and half the price of the one cloverleaf that they decided to rebuild in that city. These changes and others like them changed the way that Portlanders live  and their vehicle miles traveled per day  the amount that each person drives  actually peaked in       has been dropping ever since  and they now drive    percent less than the rest of the country. The typical Portland citizen drives four miles less  and    minutes less per day than they did before. The economist Joe Cortright did the math and he found out that those four miles plus those    minutes adds up to fully three and a half percent of all income earned in the region. So if they're not spending that money on driving    and by the way     percent of the money we spend on driving leaves the local economy    if they're not spending that money on driving  what are they spending it on  Well  Portland is reputed to have the most roof racks per capita  the most independent bookstores per capita  the most strip clubs per capita. These are all exaggerations  slight exaggerations of a fundamental truth  which is Portlanders spend a lot more on recreation of all kinds than the rest of America. Actually  Oregonians spend more on alcohol than most other states  which may be a good thing or a bad thing  but it makes you glad they're driving less. But actually  they're spending most of it in their homes  and home investment is about as local an investment as you can get. But there's a whole other Portland story  which isn't part of this calculus  which is that young  educated people have been moving to Portland in droves  so that between the last two censuses  they had a    percent increase in college educated millennials  which is five times what you saw anywhere else in the country  or  I should say  of the national average. So on the one hand  a city saves money for its residents by being more walkable and more bikeable  but on the other hand  it also is the cool kind of city that people want to be in these days. So the best economic strategy you can have as a city is not the old way of trying to attract corporations and trying to have a biotech cluster or a medical cluster  or an aerospace cluster  but to become a place where people want to be. And millennials  certainly  these engines of entrepreneurship     percent of whom decide first where they want to live  then they move there  then they look for a job  they will come to your city. The health argument is a scary one  and you've probably heard part of this argument before. Again  back in the '  s  a lot's changed since then  back in the '  s  one in    Americans was obese. Now one out of three Americans is obese  and a second third of the population is overweight. Twenty five percent of young men and    percent of young women are too heavy to enlist in our own military forces. According to the Center for Disease Control  fully one third of all children born after      will get diabetes. We have the first generation of children in America who are predicted to live shorter lives than their parents. I believe that this American healthcare crisis that we've all heard about is an urban design crisis  and that the design of our cities lies at the cure. Because we've talked a long time about diet  and we know that diet impacts weight  and weight of course impacts health. But we've only started talking about inactivity  and how inactivity born of our landscape  inactivity that comes from the fact that we live in a place where there is no longer any such thing as a useful walk  is driving our weight up. And we finally have the studies  one in Britain called  Gluttony versus sloth  that tracked weight against diet and tracked weight against inactivity  and found a much higher  stronger correlation between the latter two. Dr. James Levine at  in this case  the aptly named Mayo Clinic put his test subjects in electronic underwear  held their diet steady  and then started pumping the calories in. Some people gained weight  some people didn't gain weight. Expecting some metabolic or DNA factor at work  they were shocked to learn that the only difference between the subjects that they could figure out was the amount they were moving  and that in fact those who gained weight were sitting  on average  two hours more per day than those who didn't. So we have these studies that tie weight to inactivity  but even more  we now have studies that tie weight to where you live. Do you live in a more walkable city or do you live in a less walkable city  or where in your city do you live  In San Diego  they used Walk Score    Walk Score rates every address in America and soon the world in terms of how walkable it is    they used Walk Score to designate more walkable neighborhoods and less walkable neighborhoods. Well guess what  If you lived in a more walkable neighborhood  you were    percent likely to be overweight. If you lived in a less walkable neighborhood  you were    percent likely to be overweight. So we have study after study now that's tying where you live to your health  particularly as in America  the biggest health crisis we have is this one that's stemming from environmental induced inactivity. And I learned a new word last week. They call these neighborhoods  obesageneric.  I may have that wrong  but you get the idea. Now that's one thing  of course. Briefly mentioning  we have an asthma epidemic in this country. You probably haven't thought that much about it. Fourteen Americans die each day from asthma  three times what it was in the '  s  and it's almost all coming from car exhaust. American pollution does not come from factories anymore  it comes from tailpipes  and the amount that people are driving in your city  your urban VMT  is a good prediction of the asthma problems in your city. And then finally  in terms of driving  there's the issue of the single largest killer of healthy adults  and one of the largest killers of all people  is car crashes. And we take car crashes for granted. We figure it's a natural risk of being on the road. But in fact  here in America     people out of every         die every year from car crashes. We're pretty safe here. Well  guess what  In England  it's seven per        . It's Japan  it's four per        . Do you know where it's three per          New York City. San Francisco  the same thing. Portland  the same thing. Oh  so cities make us safer because we're driving less  Tulsa     per        . Orlando     per        . It's not whether you're in the city or not  it's how is your city designed  Was it designed around cars or around people  Because if your city is designed around cars  it's really good at smashing them into each other. That's part of a much larger health argument. Finally  the environmental argument is fascinating  because the environmentalists turned on a dime about    years ago. The environmental movement in America has historically been an anti city movement from Jefferson on.  Cities are pestilential to the health  to the liberties  to the morals of man. If we continue to pile upon ourselves in cities  as they do in Europe  we shall become as corrupt as they are in Europe and take to eating one another as they do there.  He apparently had a sense of humor. And then the American environmental movement has been a classically Arcadian movement. To become more environmental  we move into the country  we commune with nature  we build suburbs. But  of course  we've seen what that does. The carbon mapping of America  where is the CO  being emitted  for many years only hammered this argument in more strongly. If you look at any carbon map  because we map it per square mile  any carbon map of the U.S.  it looks like a night sky satellite photo of the U.S.  hottest in the cities  cooler in the suburbs  dark  peaceful in the countryside. Until some economists said  you know  is that the right way to measure CO   There are only so many people in this country at any given time  and we can choose to live where perhaps we would have a lighter impact. And they said  let's measure CO  per household  and when they did that  the maps just flipped  coolest in the center city  warmer in the suburbs  and red hot in these exurban  drive till you qualify  neighborhoods. So a fundamental shift  and now you have environmentalists and economists like Ed Glaeser saying we are a destructive species. If you love nature  the best thing you can do is stay the heck away from it  move to a city  and the denser the better  and the denser cities like Manhattan are the cities that perform the best. So the average Manhattanite is consuming gasoline at the rate the rest of the nation hasn't seen since the '  s  consuming half of the electricity of Dallas. But of course  we can do better. Canadian cities  they consume half the gasoline of American cities. European cities consume half as much again. So obviously  we can do better  and we want to do better  and we're all trying to be green. My final argument in this topic is that I think we're trying to be green the wrong way  and I'm one of many people who believes that this focus on gadgets  on accessorizing    What can I add to my house  what can I add to what I've already got to make my lifestyle more sustainable     has kind of dominated the discussion. So I'm not immune to this. My wife and I built a new house on an abandoned lot in Washington  D.C.  and we did our best to clear the shelves of the sustainability store. We've got the solar photovoltaic system  solar hot water heater  dual flush toilets  bamboo floors. A log burning in my German high tech stove apparently  supposedly  contributes less carbon to the atmosphere than were it left alone to decompose in the forest. Yet all of these innovations    That's what they said in the brochure. All of these innovations together contribute a fraction of what we contribute by living in a walkable neighborhood three blocks from a metro in the heart of a city. We've changed all our light bulbs to energy savers  and you should do the same thing  but changing all your light bulbs to energy savers saves as much energy in a year as moving to a walkable city does in a week. And we don't want to have this argument. Politicians and marketers are afraid of marketing green as a  lifestyle choice.  You don't want to tell Americans  God forbid  that they have to change their lifestyle. But what if lifestyle was really about quality of life and about perhaps something that we would all enjoy more  something that would be better than what we have right now  Well  the gold standard of quality of life rankings  it's called the Mercer Survey. You may have heard of it. They rank hundreds of nations worldwide according to    criteria that they believe add up to quality of life  health  economics  education  housing  you name it. There's six more. Short talk. And it's very interesting to see that the highest ranking American city  Honolulu  number     is followed by kind of the usual suspects of Seattle and Boston and all walkable cities. The driving cities in the Sun Belt  the Dallases and the Phoenixes and  sorry  Atlanta  these cities are not appearing on the list. But who's doing even better  The Canadian cities like Vancouver  where again  they're burning half the fuel. And then it's usually won by cities where they speak German  like Dusseldorf or Vienna  where they're burning  again  half as much fuel. And you see this alignment  this strange alignment. Is being more sustainble what gives you a higher quality of life  I would argue the same thing that makes you more sustainble is what gives you a higher quality of life  and that's living in a walkable neighborhood. So sustainability  which includes our wealth and our health may not be a direct function of our sustainability. But particularly here in America  we are polluting so much because we're throwing away our time and our money and our lives on the highway  then these two problems would seem to share the same solution  which is to make our cities more walkable. Doing so isn't easy  but it can be done  it has been done  and it's being done now in more than a few cities  around the globe and in our country. I take some solace from Winston Churchill  who put it this way   The Americans can be counted on to do the right thing once they have exhausted the alternatives.

And I can't believe you're here and that I'm meeting you here at TED. And also  I can't believe that we're eating sushi in front of the fish tank  which  personally  I think is really inappropriate. And little did I know that one year later ...   we'd be doing this show.     Sobule  I sing. Sweeney  I tell stories. Together  The Jill and Julia Show.

Oprah was never necessarily a big hero of mine. I mean  I watch Oprah mostly when I'm home in Spokane visiting my mother. And to my mother  Oprah is a greater moral authority than the Pope  which is actually saying something because she's a devout Catholic. Anyway  I like Oprah    I like her girlfriendy ness  I like her weight issues  I like how she's transformed talk television  I like how she's brought reading back to America    but there was something that happened the last two weeks that was ... I call it the Soon Yi moment  it is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone. And that was that she did two entire shows promoting that movie  The Secret.  Do you guys know about that movie  The Secret   It makes  What the Bleep Do We Know  seem like a doctoral dissertation from Harvard on quantum mechanics    that's how bad it is. It makes  The DaVinci Code  seem like  War and Peace.  That movie is so horrible. It promotes such awful pseudoscience. And the basic idea is that there's this law of attraction  and your thoughts have this vibrating energy that goes out into the universe and then you attract good things to happen to you. On a scientific basis  it's more than just  Power of Positive Thinking     it has a horrible  horrible dark side. Like if you get ill  it's because you've just been thinking negative thoughts. Yeah  stuff like that was in the movie and she's promoting it. And all I'm saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell Mann would go on Oprah and just explain to her that the law of attraction is  in fact  not a law. So that's what I have to say.   Sobule  I sing. Sweeney  I tell stories. Together  The Jill and Julia Show.     Sobule  Sometimes it works. Sweeney  Sometimes it doesn't.     Together  The Jill and Julia  the Jill and Julia  the Jill and Julia Show.  ,nan,200802,5.83071428571,496839,TED2007,2007-03-03,20070303
a_robot_that_flies_like_a_bird,2010,2012,Markus Fischer 2011,Markus Fischer,male,A robot that flies like a bird,Jul 2011,359,It is a dream of mankind to fly like a bird. Birds are very agile. They fly  not with rotating components  so they fly only by flapping their wings. So we looked at the birds  and we tried to make a model that is powerful  ultralight  and it must have excellent aerodynamic qualities that would fly by its own and only by flapping its wings. So what would be better than to use the herring gull  in its freedom  circling and swooping over the sea  and to use this as a role model  So we bring a team together. There are generalists and also specialists in the field of aerodynamics  in the field of building gliders. And the task was to build an ultralight indoor flying model that is able to fly over your heads. So be careful later on. And this was one issue  to build it that lightweight that no one would be hurt if it fell down. So why do we do all this  We are a company in the field of automation  and we'd like to do very lightweight structures because that's energy efficient  and we'd like to learn more about pneumatics and air flow phenomena. So I now would like you to put your seat belts on and put your hats on. So maybe we'll try it once    to fly a SmartBird. Thank you. So we can now look at the SmartBird. So here is one without a skin. We have a wingspan of about two meters. The length is one meter and six  and the weight is only     grams. And it is all out of carbon fiber. In the middle we have a motor  and we also have a gear in it  and we use the gear to transfer the circulation of the motor. So within the motor  we have three Hall sensors  so we know exactly where the wing is. And if we now beat up and down    We have the possibility to fly like a bird. So if you go down  you have the large area of propulsion  and if you go up  the wings are not that large  and it is easier to get up. So  the next thing we did  or the challenges we did  was to coordinate this movement. We have to turn it  go up and go down. We have a split wing. With the split wing  we get the lift at the upper wing  and we get the propulsion at the lower wing. Also  we see how we measure the aerodynamic efficiency. We had knowledge about the electromechanical efficiency and then we can calculate the aerodynamic efficiency. So therefore  it rises up from passive torsion to active torsion  from    percent up to    percent. Next thing we have to do  we have to control and regulate the whole structure. Only if you control and regulate it  you will get that aerodynamic efficiency. So the overall consumption of energy is about    watts at takeoff and    to    watts in flight. Thank you. Bruno Giussani  Markus  we should fly it once more. Markus Fischer  Yeah  sure.,Designer,201107,6.25319327731,6331411,TEDGlobal 2011,2011-07-15,20110715
two_young_scientists_break_down_plastics_with_bacteria,499,501,Miranda Wang and Jeanny Yao 2013,Miranda Wang and Jeanny Yao,they (both female),Two young scientists break down plastics with bacteria,Jul 2013,11,Miranda Wang  We're here to talk about accidents. How do you feel about accidents  When we think about accidents  we usually consider them to be harmful  unfortunate or even dangerous  and they certainly can be. But are they always that bad  The discovery that had led to penicillin  for example  is one of the most fortunate accidents of all time. Without biologist Alexander Fleming's moldy accident  caused by a neglected workstation  we wouldn't be able to fight off so many bacterial infections. Jeanny Yao  Miranda and I are here today because we'd like to share how our accidents have led to discoveries. In       we visited the Vancouver Waste Transfer Station and saw an enormous pit of plastic waste. We realized that when plastics get to the dump  it's difficult to sort them because they have similar densities  and when they're mixed with organic matter and construction debris  it's truly impossible to pick them out and environmentally eliminate them. MW  However  plastics are useful because they're durable  flexible  and can be easily molded into so many useful shapes. The downside of this convenience is that there's a high cost to this. Plastics cause serious problems  such as the destruction of ecosystems  the pollution of natural resources  and the reduction of available land space. This picture you see here is the Great Pacific Gyre. When you think about plastic pollution and the marine environment  we think about the Great Pacific Gyre  which is supposed to be a floating island of plastic waste. But that's no longer an accurate depiction of plastic pollution in the marine environment. Right now  the ocean is actually a soup of plastic debris  and there's nowhere you can go in the ocean where you wouldn't be able to find plastic particles. JY  In a plastic dependent society  cutting down production is a good goal  but it's not enough. And what about the waste that's already been produced  Plastics take hundreds to thousands of years to biodegrade. So we thought  you know what  Instead of waiting for that garbage to sit there and pile up  let's find a way to break them down with bacteria. Sounds cool  right  Audience  Yeah. JY  Thank you. But we had a problem. You see  plastics have very complex structures and are difficult to biodegrade. Anyhow  we were curious and hopeful and still wanted to give it a go. MW  With this idea in mind  Jeanny and I read through some hundreds of scientific articles on the Internet  and we drafted a research proposal in the beginning of our grade    year. We aimed to find bacteria from our local Fraser River that can degrade a harmful plasticizer called phthalates. Phthalates are additives used in everyday plastic products to increase their flexibility  durability and transparency. Although they're part of the plastic  they're not covalently bonded to the plastic backbone. As a result  they easily escape into our environment. Not only do phthalates pollute our environment  but they also pollute our bodies. To make the matter worse  phthalates are found in products to which we have a high exposure  such as babies' toys  beverage containers  cosmetics  and even food wraps. Phthalates are horrible because they're so easily taken into our bodies. They can be absorbed by skin contact  ingested  and inhaled. JY  Every year  at least     million pounds of phthalates contaminate our air  water and soil. The Environmental Protection Agency even classified this group as a top priority pollutant because it's been shown to cause cancer and birth defects by acting as a hormone disruptor. We read that each year  the Vancouver municipal government monitors phthalate concentration levels in rivers to assess their safety. So we figured  if there are places along our Fraser River that are contaminated with phthalates  and if there are bacteria that are able to live in these areas  then perhaps  perhaps these bacteria could have evolved to break down phthalates. MW  So we presented this good idea to Dr. Lindsay Eltis at the University of British Columbia  and surprisingly  he actually took us into his lab and asked his graduate students Adam and James to help us. Little did we know at that time that a trip to the dump and some research on the Internet and plucking up the courage to act upon inspiration would take us on a life changing journey of accidents and discoveries. JY  The first step in our project was to collect soil samples from three different sites along the Fraser River. Out of thousands of bacteria  we wanted to find ones that could break down phthalates  so we enriched our cultures with phthalates as the only carbon source. This implied that  if anything grew in our cultures  then they must be able to live off of phthalates. Everything went well from there  and we became amazing scientists.  Laughter  MW  Um... uh  Jeanny. JY  I'm just joking. MW  Okay. Well  it was partially my fault. You see  I accidentally cracked the flask that had contained our third enrichment culture  and as a result  we had to wipe down the incubator room with bleach and ethanol twice. And this is only one of the examples of the many accidents that happened during our experimentation. But this mistake turned out to be rather serendipitous. We noticed that the unharmed cultures came from places of opposite contamination levels  so this mistake actually led us to think that perhaps we can compare the different degradative potentials of bacteria from sites of opposite contamination levels. JY  Now that we grew the bacteria  we wanted to isolate strains by streaking onto mediate plates  because we thought that would be less accident prone  but we were wrong again. We poked holes in our agar while streaking and contaminated some samples and funghi. As a result  we had to streak and restreak several times. Then we monitored phthalate utilization and bacterial growth  and found that they shared an inverse correlation  so as bacterial populations increased  phthalate concentrations decreased. This means that our bacteria were actually living off of phthalates. MW  So now that we found bacteria that could break down phthalates  we wondered what these bacteria were. So Jeanny and I took three of our most efficient strains and then performed gene amplification sequencing on them and matched our data with an online comprehensive database. We were happy to see that  although our three strains had been previously identified bacteria  two of them were not previously associated with phthalate degradation  so this was actually a novel discovery. JY  To better understand how this biodegradation works  we wanted to verify the catabolic pathways of our three strains. To do this  we extracted enzymes from our bacteria and reacted with an intermediate of phthalic acid. MW  We monitored this experiment with spectrophotometry and obtained this beautiful graph. This graph shows that our bacteria really do have a genetic pathway to biodegrade phthalates. Our bacteria can transform phthalates  which is a harmful toxin  into end products such as carbon dioxide  water and alcohol. I know some of you in the crowd are thinking  well  carbon dioxide is horrible  it's a greenhouse gas. But if our bacteria did not evolve to break down phthalates  they would have used some other kind of carbon source  and aerobic respiration would have led it to have end products such as carbon dioxide anyway. We were also interested to see that  although we've obtained greater diversity of bacteria biodegraders from the bird habitat site  we obtained the most efficient degraders from the landfill site. So this fully shows that nature evolves through natural selection. JY  So Miranda and I shared this research at the Sanofi BioGENEius Challenge competition and were recognized with the greatest commercialization potential. Although we're not the first ones to find bacteria that can break down phthalates  we were the first ones to look into our local river and find a possible solution to a local problem. We have not only shown that bacteria can be the solution to plastic pollution  but also that being open to uncertain outcomes and taking risks create opportunities for unexpected discoveries. Throughout this journey  we have also discovered our passion for science  and are currently continuing research on other fossil fuel chemicals in university. We hope that in the near future  we'll be able to create model organisms that can break down not only phthalates but a wide variety of different contaminants. We can apply this to wastewater treatment plants to clean up our rivers and other natural resources. And perhaps one day we'll be able to tackle the problem of solid plastic waste. MW  I think our journey has truly transformed our view of microorganisms  and Jeanny and I have shown that even mistakes can lead to discoveries. Einstein once said   You can't solve problems by using the same kind of thinking you used when you created them.  If we're making plastic synthetically  then we think the solution would be to break them down biochemically. Thank you. JY  Thank you.,Science fair winners,201307,5.7848019802,1237538,TED2013,2013-02-28,20130228
nicholas_negroponte_on_one_laptop_per_child_two_years_on,1253,1255,Nicholas Negroponte 2008,Nicholas Negroponte,male,"One Laptop per Child, two years on",Jun 2008,984,Most people don't know that when I went to high school in this country    I applied for university at a time when I was convinced I was going to be an artist and be a sculptor. And I came from a very privileged background. I was very lucky. My family was wealthy  and my father believed in one thing  and that was to give us all as much education as we wanted. And I announced I wanted to be a sculptor in Paris. And he was a clever man. He sort of said   Well  that's OK  but you've done very well in your math SATs.  In fact  I'd got an    . And he thought I did very well    and I did  too    in the arts  this was my passion. And he said  If you go to MIT   to which I had been given early admission   I will pay for every year you're at MIT  in graduate or undergraduate    as much as you want    I will pay for an equal number of years for you to live in Paris.  And I thought that was the best deal in town  so I accepted it immediately. And I decided that if I was good in art  and I was good in mathematics  I'd study architecture  which was the blending of the two. I went and told my headmaster that  at prep school. And I said to him what I was doing  that I was going to go study architecture because it was art and mathematics put together. He said to me something that just went completely over my head. He said   You know  I like grey suits  and I like pin striped suits  but I don't like grey pin striped suits.  And I thought   What a turkey this guy is   and I went off to MIT. I studied architecture  then did a second degree in architecture  and then actually quickly realized that it wasn't architecture. That really  the mixing of art and science was computers  and that that really was the place to bring both  and enjoyed a career doing that. And probably  if I were to fill out Jim Citrin's scale  I'd put     percent on the side of the equation where you spend time making it possible for others to be creative. And after doing this for a long time  and the Media Lab passing the baton on  I thought   Well  maybe it's time for me to do a project. Something that would be important  but also something that would take advantage of all of these privileges that one had.  And in the case of the Media Lab  knowing a lot of people  knowing people who were either executives or wealthy  and also not having  in my own case  a career to worry about anymore. My career  I mean  I'd done my career. Didn't have to worry about earning money. Didn't have to worry about what people thought about me. And I said   Boy  let's really do something that takes advantage of all these features   and thought that if we could address education  by leveraging the children  and bringing to the world the access of the computers  that that was really the thing we should do. Never shown this picture before  and probably going to be sued for it. It's taken at three o'clock in the morning  without the permission of the company. It's about two weeks old. There they are  folks. If you look at the picture  you'll see they're stacked up. Those are conveyor belts that go around. This is one of the conveyor belts with the thing going by  but then you'll see the ones up above. What happens is  they burn into flash memory the software  and then test them for a few hours. But you've got to have the thing moving on the assembly line  because it's constant. So they go around in this loop  which is why you see them up there. So this was great for us because it was a real turning point. But it goes back. This picture was taken in       just before the IBM PC was even announced. Seymour Papert and I were bringing computers to schools and developing nations at a time when it was way ahead of itself. But one thing we learned was that these kids can absolutely jump into it just the same way as our kids do here. And when people tell me   Who's going to teach the teachers to teach the kids   I say to myself   What planet do you come from   Okay  there's not a person in this room    I don't care how techie you are    there's not a person in this room that doesn't give their laptop or cell phone to a kid to help them debug it. OK  We all need help  even those of us who are very seasoned. This picture of Seymour       years ago. Seymour made a very simple observation in       and then basically presented it in         April    to be precise    called  Teaching Children Thinking.  What he observed was that kids who write computer programs understand things differently  and when they debug the programs  they come the closest to learning about learning. That was very important  and in some sense  we've lost that. Kids don't program enough and boy  if there's anything I hope this brings back  it's programming to kids. It's really important. Using applications is OK  but programming is absolutely fundamental. This is being launched with three languages in it  Squeak  Logo  and a third  that I've never even seen before. The point being  this is going to be very  very intensive on the programming side. This photograph is very important because it's much later. This is in the early     s. My son  Dimitri    who's here  many of you know Dimitri    went to Cambodia  set up this school that we had built  just as the school connected it to the Internet. And these kids had their laptops. But it was really what spirited this  plus the influence of Joe and others. We started One Laptop per Child. This is the same village in Cambodia  just a couple of months ago. These kids are real pros. There were just       machines out there being tested by kids. Being a nonprofit is absolutely fundamental. Everybody advised me not to be a nonprofit  but they were all wrong. And the reason being a nonprofit is important is actually twofold. There are many reasons  but the two that merit the little bit of time is  one  the clarity of purpose is there. The moral purpose is clear. I can see any head of state  any executive I want  at any time  because I'm not selling laptops. OK  I have no shareholders. Whether we sell  it doesn't make any difference whatsoever. The clarity of purpose is absolutely critical. And the second is very counterintuitive    you can get the best people in the world. If you look at our professional services  including search firms  including communications  including legal services  including banking  they're all pro bono. And it's not to save money. We've got money in the bank. It's because you get the best people. You get the people who are doing it because they believe in the mission  and they're the best people. We couldn't afford to hire a CFO. We put out a job description for a CFO at zero salary  and we had a queue of people. It allows you to team up with people. The U.N.'s not going to be our partner if we're profit making. So announcing this with Kofi Annan was very important  and the U.N. allowed us to basically reach all the countries. And this was the machine we were showing before I met Yves Behar. And while this machine in some sense is silly  in retrospect  it actually served a very important purpose. That pencil yellow crank was remembered by everybody. Everybody remembered the pencil yellow crank. It's different. It was getting its power in a different way. It's kind of childlike. Even though this wasn't the direction we went because the crank    it really is stupid to have it on board  by the way. In spite of what some people in the press don't get it  didn't understand it  we didn't take it off because we didn't want to do    having it on the laptop itself is really not what you want. You want a separate thing  like the AC adaptor. I didn't bring one with me  but they really work much better off board. And then  I could tell you lots about the laptop  but I decided on just four things. Just keep in mind    because there are other people  including Bill Gates  who said   Gee  you've got a real computer.  That computer is unlike anything you've had  and does things    there are four of them    that you don't come close to. And it's very important to be low power  and I hope that's picked up more by the industry. That the reason that you want to be below two watts is that's roughly what you can generate with your upper body. Dual mode display    that sunlight display's fantastic. We were using it at lunch today in the sunlight  and the more sunlight the better. And that was really critical. The mesh network  it'll become commonplace. And of course   rugged  goes without saying. And the reason I think design matters isn't because I wanted to go to art school. And by the way  when I graduated from MIT  I thought the worst and silliest thing to do would be to go to Paris for six years.  Laughter  So  I didn't do that. But design matters for a number of reasons. The most important being that it is the best way to make an inexpensive product. Most people make inexpensive products by taking cheap design  cheap labor  cheap components  and making a cheap laptop. And  in English  the word  cheap  has a double meaning  which is really appropriate  because it's cheap  in the pejorative sense  as well as inexpensive. But if you take a different approach  and you think of very large scale integration  very advanced materials  very advanced manufacturing    so you're pouring chemicals in one end  iPods are spewing out the other    and really cool design  that's what we wanted to do. And I can race through these and save a lot of time because Yves and I obviously didn't compare notes. These are his slides  and so I don't have to talk about them. But it was really  to us  very important as a strategy. It wasn't just to kind of make it cute  because somebody    you know  good design is very important. Yves showed one of the power generating devices. The mesh network  the reason I    and I won't go into it in great detail    but when we deliver laptops to kids in the remotest and poorest parts of the world  they're connected. There's not just laptops. And so  we have to drop in satellite dishes. We put in generators. It's a lot of stuff that goes behind these. These can talk to each other. If you're in a desert  they can talk to each other about two kilometers apart. If you're in the jungle  it's about     meters. So if a kid bicycles home  or walks a few miles  they're going to be off the grid  so to speak. They're not going to be near another laptop  so you have to nail these onto a tree  and sort of  get it. You don't call Verizon or Sprint. You build your own network. And that's very important  the user interface. We are launching with    keyboards. English is by far the minority. Latin is relatively rare  too. You just look at some of the languages. I'm willing to suspect some of you hadn't even heard of them before. Is there anybody in the room  one person  unless you work with OLPC  is there anybody in the room that can tell me what language the keyboard is that's on the screen  There's only one hand    so you get it. Yes  you're right. He's right. It's Amharic  it's Ethiopian. In Ethiopia  there's never been a keyboard. There is no keyboard standard because there's no market. And this is the big difference. Again  when you're a nonprofit  you look at children as a mission  not as a market. So we went to Ethiopia  and we helped them make a keyboard. And this will become the standard Ethiopian keyboard. So what I want to end with is sort of what we're doing to roll it out. And we changed strategy completely. I decided at the beginning    it was a pretty good thing to decide in the beginning  it's not what we're doing now    is to go to six countries. Big countries  one of them is not so big  but it's rich. Here's the six. We went to the six  and in each case the head of state said he would do it  he'd do a million. In the case of Gaddafi  he'd do  .  million  and that they would launch it. We thought  this is exactly the right strategy  get it out  and then the little countries could sort of piggyback on these big countries. And so I went to each of those countries at least six times  met with the head of state probably two or three times. In each case  got the ministers  went through a lot of the stuff. This was a period in my life where I was traveling     days per year. Not something you'd envy or want to do. In the case of Libya  it was a lot of fun meeting Gaddafi in his tent. The camel smells were unbelievable. And it was    degrees C. I mean  this was not what you'd call a cool experience. And former countries    I say former  because none of them really came through this summer    there was a big difference between getting a head of state to have a photo opportunity  make a press release. So we went to smaller ones. Uruguay  bless their hearts. Small country  not so rich. President said he'd do it  and guess what  He did do it. The tender had nothing in it that related to us  nothing specific about sunlight readable  mesh network  low power  but just a vanilla laptop proposal. And guess what  We won it hands down. When it was announced that they were going to do every child in Uruguay  the first          boom  went to OLPC. The next day    the next day  not even    hours had passed    in Peru  the president of Peru said   We'll do    .  And boom  a little domino effect. The president of Rwanda stepped in and said he would do it. The president of Ethiopia said he would do it. And boom  boom  boom. The president of Mongolia. And so what happens is  these things start to happen with these countries    still not enough. Add up all those countries  it didn't quite get to thing  so we said   Let's start a program in the United States.  So  end of August  early September  we decide to do this. We announced it near the middle  end    just when the Clinton Initiative was taking place. We thought that was a good time to announce it. Launched it on the    of November. We said it would be just for a short period until the   . We've extended it until the   . And the  Give One  Get One  program is really important because it got a lot of people absolutely interested. The first day it was just wild. And then we said   Well  let's get people to give many. Not just one  and get one  but maybe give      give      .  And that's where you come in. And that's where I think it's very important. I don't want you all to go out and buy     dollars worth of laptops. Okay  Do it  but that's not going to help. Okay  If everybody in this room goes out tonight and orders one of these things for     dollars  whatever it is      people in the room doing it    yeah  great. I want you do something else. And it's not to go out and buy     or        though  I invite you to do that  and        would be even better. Tell people about it  It's got to become viral  OK  Use your mailing lists. People in this room have extraordinary mailing lists. Get your friends to give one  get one. And if each one of you sends it to     or     people  that would be fantastic. I won't dwell on the pricing at all. Just to say that when you do the  Give One  Get One   a lot of press is a bit about   They didn't make it  it's     dollars  it's not    .  It will be     in two years. It will go below    . We've pledged not to add features  but to bring that price down. But it was the countries that wanted it to go up  and we let them push it up for all sorts of reasons. So what you can do    I've just said it. Don't just give one  get one. I just want to end with one last one. This one is not even    hours old  or maybe it's    hours. The first kids got their laptops. They got them by ship  and I'm talking now about              at a time went out this week. They went to Uruguay  Peru  Mexico. And it's been slow coming  and we're only making about       a week  but we hope  we hope  sometime in next year  maybe by the middle of the year  to hit a million a month. Now put that number  and a million isn't so much. It's not a big number. We're selling a billion cell phones worldwide this year. But a million a month in laptop land is a big number. And the world production today  everybody combined  making laptops  is five million a month. So I'm standing here telling you that sometime next year  we're going to make    percent of the world production. And if we do that  there are going to be a lot of lucky kids out there. And we hope if you have EG two years from now  or whenever you have it again  I won't have bad breath  and I will be invited back  and will have  hopefully by then  maybe     million out there to children.

debate_does_the_world_need_nuclear_energy,1721,1723,Stewart Brand + Mark Z. Jacobson 2010,Stewart Brand + Mark Z. Jacobson,male,Debate: Does the world need nuclear energy?,Jun 2010,1365,Chris Anderson  We're having a debate. The debate is over the proposition   What the world needs now is nuclear energy.  True or false  And before we have the debate  I'd like to actually take a show of hands    on balance  right now  are you for or against this  So those who are  yes   raise your hand.  For.  Okay  hands down. Those who are against  raise your hands. Okay  I'm reading that at about    to    in favor at the start. Which means we're going to take a vote at the end and see how that shifts  if at all. So here's the format  They're going to have six minutes each  and then after one little  quick exchange between them  I want two people on each side of this debate in the audience to have    seconds to make one short  crisp  pungent  powerful point. So  in favor of the proposition  possibly shockingly  is one of  truly  the founders of the environmental movement  a long standing TEDster  the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog  someone we all know and love  Stewart Brand. Stewart Brand  Whoa. The saying is that with climate  those who know the most are the most worried. With nuclear  those who know the most are the least worried. A classic example is James Hansen  a NASA climatologist pushing for     parts per million carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. He came out with a wonderful book recently called  Storms of My Grandchildren.  And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power  as are most climatologists who are engaging this issue seriously. This is the design situation  a planet that is facing climate change and is now half urban. Look at the client base for this. Five out of six of us live in the developing world. We are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world. And we are educating our kids  having fewer kids  basically good news all around. But we move to cities  toward the bright lights  and one of the things that is there that we want  besides jobs  is electricity. And if it isn't easily gotten  we'll go ahead and steal it. This is one of the most desired things by poor people all over the world  in the cities and in the countryside. Electricity for cities  at its best  is what's called baseload electricity. That's where it is on all the time. And so far there are only three major sources of that    coal and gas  hydro electric  which in most places is maxed out    and nuclear. I would love to have something in the fourth place here  but in terms of constant  clean  scalable energy   solar  and wind and the other renewables aren't there yet because they're inconstant. Nuclear is and has been for    years. Now  from an environmental standpoint  the main thing you want to look at is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal  the two major sources of electricity. If all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear  the waste from that lifetime of electricity would go in a Coke can    a pretty heavy Coke can  about two pounds. But one day of coal adds up to one hell of a lot of carbon dioxide in a normal one gigawatt coal fired plant. Then what happens to the waste  The nuclear waste typically goes into a dry cask storage out back of the parking lot at the reactor site because most places don't have underground storage yet. It's just as well  because it can stay where it is. While the carbon dioxide  vast quantities of it  gigatons  goes into the atmosphere where we can't get it back    yet    and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about. So when you add up the greenhouse gases in the lifetime of these various energy sources  nuclear is down there with wind and hydro  below solar and way below  obviously  all the fossil fuels. Wind is wonderful  I love wind. I love being around these big wind generators. But one of the things we're discovering is that wind  like solar  is an actually relatively dilute source of energy. And so it takes a very large footprint on the land  a very large footprint in terms of materials  five to    times what you'd use for nuclear  and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity is on the order of     square miles of wind farm. In places like Denmark and Germany  they've maxed out on wind already. They've run out of good sites. The power lines are getting overloaded. And you peak out. Likewise  with solar  especially here in California  we're discovering that the    solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldoze       square miles of southern California desert. Well  as an environmentalist  we would rather that didn't happen. It's okay on frapped out agricultural land. Solar's wonderful on rooftops. But out in the landscape  one gigawatt is on the order of    square miles of bulldozed desert. When you add all these things up    Saul Griffith did the numbers and figured out what would it take to get    clean terawatts of energy from wind  solar and biofuels  and that area would be roughly the size of the United States  an area he refers to as  Renewistan.  A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay  a physicist in England  and in his wonderful book   Sustainable Energy   among other things  he says   I'm not trying to be pro nuclear. I'm just pro arithmetic.  In terms of weapons  the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy. We have been taking down the Russian warheads  turning it into electricity. Ten percent of American electricity comes from decommissioned warheads. We haven't even started the American stockpile. I think of most interest to a TED audience would be the new generation of reactors that are very small  down around    to     megawatts. This is one from Toshiba. Here's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge. And that would be very interesting in the developing world. Typically  these things are put in the ground. They're referred to as nuclear batteries. They're incredibly safe  weapons proliferation proof and all the rest of it. Here is a commercial version from New Mexico called the Hyperion  and another one from Oregon called NuScale. Babcock   Wilcox that make nuclear reactors  here's an integral fast reactor. Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in. The governments of the world are going to have to decide that coals need to be made expensive  and these will go ahead. And here's the future. CA  Okay. Okay. So arguing against  a man who's been at the nitty  gritty heart of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years. In       he discovered that soot was probably the second leading cause of global warming  after CO . His team have been making detailed calculations of the relative impacts of different energy sources. His first time at TED  possibly a disadvantage    we shall see    from Stanford  Professor Mark Jacobson. Good luck. Mark Jacobson  Thank you. So my premise here is that nuclear energy puts out more carbon dioxide  puts out more air pollutants  enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up than real renewable energy systems  namely wind  solar  geothermal power  hydro tidal wave power. And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation. So let's start just by looking at the CO  emissions from the life cycle. CO e emissions are equivalent emissions of all the greenhouse gases and particles that cause warming and converted to CO . And if you look  wind and concentrated solar have the lowest CO  emissions  if you look at the graph. Nuclear    there are two bars here. One is a low estimate  and one is a high estimate. The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry estimate of nuclear. The high is the average of     scientific  peer reviewed studies. And this is just the CO  from the life cycle. If we look at the delays  it takes between    and    years to put up a nuclear power plant from planning to operation. This includes about three and a half to six years for a site permit. and another two and a half to four years for a construction permit and issue  and then four to nine years for actual construction. And in China  right now  they're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear. And the average  just for the construction time of these  is  .  years on top of any planning times. While you're waiting around for your nuclear  you have to run the regular electric power grid  which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world. And the chart here shows the difference between the emissions from the regular grid  resulting if you use nuclear  or anything else  versus wind  CSP or photovoltaics. Wind takes about two to five years on average  same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics. So the difference is the opportunity cost of using nuclear versus wind  or something else. So if you add these two together  alone  you can see a separation that nuclear puts out at least nine to    times more CO  equivalent emissions than wind energy. And this doesn't even account for the footprint on the ground. If you look at the air pollution health effects  this is the number of deaths per year in      just from vehicle exhaust. Let's say we converted all the vehicles in the United States to battery electric vehicles  hydrogen fuel cell vehicles or flex fuel vehicles run on E  . Well  right now in the United States     to         people die per year from air pollution  and vehicles are about        of those. In       the number will go down to        due to improvements. And so  on the right  you see gasoline emissions  the death rates of     . If you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol  you'd actually increase the death rate slightly. If you go to nuclear  you do get a big reduction  but it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar. Now if you consider the fact that nuclear weapons proliferation is associated with nuclear energy proliferation  because we know for example  India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly by enriching uranium in nuclear energy facilities. North Korea did that to some extent. Iran is doing that right now. And Venezuela would be doing it if they started with their nuclear energy facilities. If you do a large scale expansion of nuclear energy across the world  and as a result there was just one nuclear bomb created that was used to destroy a city such as Mumbai or some other big city  megacity  the additional death rates due to this averaged over    years and then scaled to the population of the U.S. would be this. So  do we need this  The next thing is  What about the footprint  Stewart mentioned the footprint. Actually  the footprint on the ground for wind is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world. That  because the footprint  as you can see  is just the pole touching the ground. And you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet with        to         five megawatt wind turbines. That would take between one and three square kilometers of footprint on the ground  entirely. The spacing is something else. That's the footprint that is always being confused. People confuse footprint with spacing. As you can see from these pictures  the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes including agricultural land  range land or open space. Over the ocean  it's not even land. Now if we look at nuclear     Laughter  With nuclear  what do we have  We have facilities around there. You also have a buffer zone that's    square kilometers. And you have the uranium mining that you have to deal with. Now if we go to the area  lots is worse than nuclear or wind. For example  cellulosic ethanol  to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet  this is how much land you would need. That's cellulosic  second generation biofuels from prairie grass. Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller. This is based on ranges from data  but if you look at nuclear  it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet. For wind  there's a larger area  but much smaller footprint. And of course  with wind  you could put it all over the East Coast  offshore theoretically  or you can split it up. And now  if you go back to looking at geothermal  it's even smaller than both  and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing  but it's still pretty small. And this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet. To power the entire world with    percent wind  you would need about one percent of world land. Matching the reliability  base load is actually irrelevant. We want to match the hour by hour power supply. You can do that by combining renewables. This is from real data in California  looking at wind data and solar data. And it considers just using existing hydro to match the hour by hour power demand. Here are the world wind resources. There's five to    times more wind available worldwide than we need for all the world. So then here's the final ranking. And one last slide I just want to show. This is the choice  You can either have wind or nuclear. If you use wind  you guarantee ice will last. Nuclear  the time lag alone will allow the Arctic to melt and other places to melt more. And we can guarantee a clean  blue sky or an uncertain future with nuclear power. CA  All right. So while they're having their comebacks on each other    and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran    I need two people from either side. So if you're for this  if you're for nuclear power  put up two hands. If you're against  put up one. And I want two of each for the mics. Now then  you guys have    you have a minute comeback on him to pick up a point he said  challenge it  whatever. SB  I think a point of difference we're having  Mark  has to do with weapons and energy. These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow putting out a lot of greenhouse gases    a lot of those studies include   Well of course war will be inevitable and therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that   which is kind of finessing it a little bit  I think. The reality is that there's  what     nations that have nuclear power  Of those  seven have nuclear weapons. In every case  they got the weapons before they got the nuclear power. There are two nations  North Korea and Israel  that have nuclear weapons and don't have nuclear power at all. The places that we would most like to have really clean energy occur are China  India  Europe  North America  all of which have sorted out their situation in relation to nuclear weapons. So that leaves a couple of places like Iran  maybe Venezuela  that you would like to have very close surveillance of anything that goes on with fissile stuff. Pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we really know where all of the fissile material is  and we can move toward zero weapons left  once we know all that. CA  Mark     seconds  either on that or on anything Stewart said. MJ  Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first  and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories. So the other thing is  we don't need nuclear energy. There's plenty of solar and wind. You can make it reliable  as I showed with that diagram. That's from real data. And this is an ongoing research. This is not rocket science. Solving the world's problems can be done  if you really put your mind to it and use clean  renewable energy. There's absolutely no need for nuclear power. CA  We need someone for. Rod Beckstrom  Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom  CEO of ICANN. I've been involved in global warming policy since       when I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund that was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol. And I want to support Stewart Brand's position. I've come around in the last    years. I used to be against nuclear power. I'm now supporting Stewart's position  softly  from a risk management standpoint  agreeing that the risks of overheating the planet outweigh the risk of nuclear incident  which certainly is possible and is a very real problem. However  I think there may be a win win solution here where both parties can win this debate  and that is  we face a situation where it's carbon caps on this planet or die. And in the United States Senate  we need bipartisan support    only one or two votes are needed    to move global warming through the Senate  and this room can help. So if we get that through  then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris. CA  Thank you Rod Beckstrom. Against. David Fanton  Hi  I'm David Fanton. I just want to say a couple quick things. The first is  be aware of the propaganda. The propaganda from the industry has been very  very strong. And we have not had the other side of the argument fully aired so that people can draw their own conclusions. Be very aware of the propaganda. Secondly  think about this. If we build all these nuclear power plants  all that waste is going to be on hundreds  if not thousands  of trucks and trains  moving through this country every day. Tell me they're not going to have accidents. Tell me that those accidents aren't going to put material into the environment that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years. And then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains isn't a potential terrorist target. CA  Thank you. For. Anyone else for  Go. Alex  Hi  I'm Alex. I just wanted to say  I'm  first of all  renewable energy's biggest fan. I've got solar PV on my roof. I've got a hydro conversion at a watermill that I own. And I'm  you know  very much  pro  that kind of stuff. However  there's a basic arithmetic problem here. The capability of the sun shining  the wind blowing and the rain falling  simply isn't enough to add up. So if we want to keep the lights on  we actually need a solution which is going to keep generating all of the time. I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '  s  and I continue to do so now. But we've got an opportunity to recycle them into something more useful that enables us to get energy all of the time. And  ultimately  the arithmetic problem isn't going to go away. We're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone. We need a solution that generates all of the time. If we're going to keep the lights on  nuclear is that solution. CA  Thank you. Anyone else against  Man  The last person who was in favor made the premise that we don't have enough alternative renewable resources. And our  against  proponent up here made it very clear that we actually do. And so the fallacy that we need this resource and we can actually make it in a time frame that is meaningful is not possible. I will also add one other thing. Ray Kurzweil and all the other talks    we know that the stick is going up exponentially. So you can't look at state of the art technologies in renewables and say   That's all we have.  Because five years from now  it will blow you away what we'll actually have as alternatives to this horrible  disastrous nuclear power. CA  Point well made. Thank you. So each of you has really just a couple sentences       seconds each to sum up. Your final pitch  Stewart. SB  I loved your  It all balances out  chart that you had there. It was a sunny day and a windy night. And just now in England they had a cold spell. All of the wind in the entire country shut down for a week. None of those things were stirring. And as usual  they had to buy nuclear power from France. Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel. This keeps happening. I used to worry about the        year factor. And the fact is  we're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel in the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along. And especially the small reactors need to go forward. I heard from Nathan Myhrvold    and I think here's the action point    it'll take an act of Congress to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission start moving quickly on these small reactors  which we need very much  here and in the world. MJ  So we've analyzed the hour by hour power demand and supply  looking at solar  wind  using data for California. And you can match that demand  hour by hour  for the whole year almost. Now  with regard to the resources  we've developed the first wind map of the world  from data alone  at    meters. We know what the wind resources are. You can cover    percent. Fifteen percent of the entire U.S. has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost competitive. And there's much more solar than there is wind. There's plenty of resource. You can make it reliable. CA  Okay. So  thank you  Mark. So if you were in Palm Springs ... Shameless. Shameless. Shameless. So  people of the TED community  I put it to you that what the world needs now is nuclear energy. All those in favor  raise your hands. And all those against. Ooooh. Now that is    my take on that ... Just put up ... Hands up  people who changed their minds during the debate  who voted differently. Those of you who changed your mind in favor of  for  put your hands up. Okay. So here's the read on it. Both people won supporters  but on my count  the mood of the TED community shifted from about    to    to about    to    in favor  in favor. You both won. I congratulate both of you. Thank you for that.,nan,201006,5.80662514156,1327023,TED2010,2010-02-12,20100212
tom_shannon_the_painter_and_the_pendulum,1628,1630,"Tom Shannon, John Hockenberry 2010","Tom Shannon, John Hockenberry",male,The painter and the pendulum,Feb 2010,788,John Hockenberry  It's great to be here with you  Tom. And I want to start with a question that has just been consuming me since I first became familiar with your work. In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force in some sort of interplay with creative force. Are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work  Tom Shannon  Yeah  the subject matter that I'm looking for  it's usually to solve a question. I had the question popped into my head  What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like if you could connect the two spheres  And in proportion  what would the size of the sphere and the length  and what would the taper be to the Earth  And so I went about and made that sculpture  turning it out of solid bronze. And I did one that was about    feet long. The sun end was about four inches in diameter  and then it tapered over about    feet to about a millimeter at the Earth end. And so for me  it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context  as though you were an astronaut  and see these two things as an object  because they are so intimately bound  and one is meaningless without the other. JH  Is there a relief in playing with these forces  And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces. TS  Well  like the magnetically levitated objects    like that silver one there  that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets  trying to find a way to make something float with the least possible connection to the ground. So I got it down to just one tether to be able to support that. JH  Now is this electromagnetic here  or are these static  TS  Those are permanent magnets  yeah. JH  Because if the power went out  there would just be a big noise. TS  Yeah. It's really unsatisfactory having plug in art. JH  I agree. TS  The magnetic works are a combination of gravity and magnetism  so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything. The sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun. So there's this huge invisible shape structures that magnetism takes in the universe. But with the pendulum  it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets up. My sculptures are normally very simplified. I try to refine them down to very simple forms. But the paintings become very complex  because I think the fields that are supporting them  they're billowing  and they're interpenetrating  and they're interference patterns. JH  And they're non deterministic. I mean  you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin  even though the forces can be calculated. So the evolution of this    I gather this isn't your first pendulum. TS  No.  JH  No.  TS  The first one I did was in the late   's  and I just had a simple cone with a spigot at the bottom of it. I threw it into an orbit  and it only had one color  and when it got to the center  the paint kept running out  so I had to run in there  didn't have any control over the spigot remotely. So that told me right away  I need a remote control device. But then I started dreaming of having six colors. I sort of think about it as the DNA    these colors  the red  blue  yellow  the primary colors and white and black. And if you put them together in different combinations    just like printing in a sense  like how a magazine color is printed    and put them under certain forces  which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them  these amazing things started appearing. JH  It looks like we're loaded for bear here. TS  Yeah  well let's put a couple of canvases. I'll ask a couple of my sons to set up the canvases here. I want to just say    so this is Jack  Nick and Louie. JH  Thanks guys. TS  So here are the    JH  All right  I'll get out of the way here. TS  I'm just going to throw this into an orbit and see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front. JH  Whoa. That is ... ooh  nice. TS  So something like this. I'm doing this as a demo  and it's more playful  but inevitably  all of this can be used. I can redeem this painting  just continuing on  doing layers upon layers. And I keep it around for a couple of weeks  and I'm contemplating it  and I'll do another session with it and bring it up to another level  where all of this becomes the background  the depth of it. JH  That's fantastic. So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are like radio controlled airplane valves. TS  Yes  they're servos with cams that pinch these rubber tubes. And they can pinch them very tight and stop it  or you can have them wide open. And all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom. You can always be changing colors  put aluminum paint  or I could put anything into this. It could be tomato sauce  or anything could be dispensed    sand  powders or anything like that. JH  So many forces there. You've got gravity  you've got the centrifugal force  you've got the fluid dynamics. Each of these beautiful paintings  are they images in and of themselves  or are they records of a physical event called the pendulum approaching the canvas  TS  Well  this painting here  I wanted to do something very simple  a simple  iconic image of two ripples interfering. So the one on the right was done first  and then the one on the left was done over it. And then I left gaps so you could see the one that was done before. And then when I did the second one  it really disturbed the piece    these big blue lines crashing through the center of it    and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap. There are lines in front of the one on the right  and there are lines behind the one on the left  and so it takes it into different planes. What it's also about  just the little events  the events of the interpenetration of    JH  Two stars  or    TS  Two things that happened    there's an interference pattern  and then a third thing happens. There are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two events that are happening  and I'm very interested in that. Like the occurrence of moire patterns. Like this green one  this is a painting I did about    years ago  but it has some    see  in the upper third    there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery. And that's something that in painting I've never seen done. I've never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns  which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives. JH  Is that a literal part of the image  or is my eye making that interference pattern    is my eye completing that interference pattern  TS  It is the paint actually  makes it real. It's really manifested there. If I throw a very concentric circle  or concentric ellipse  it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines  which get closer and closer together  which describes how gravity works. There's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that I really enjoy. And I love the shapes that I see in scientific observations and apparatus  especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it  the scale  is very interesting to me. My focus in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology. Some of these paintings  when you look at them very close  odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or crocodiles  elephants. There are lots of things that appear. When you look into it  it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns  but sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered. And then there are all these forms that we don't know what they are  but they're equally well resolved and complex. So I think  conceivably  those could be predictive. Because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we're familiar with in biology  it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with. And maybe it's the kind of forms we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars  where there are probably lakes with fish swimming under the surface. JH  Oh  let's hope so. Oh  my God  let's. Oh  please  yes. Oh  I'm so there. You know  it seems at this stage in your life  you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant    I suppose it's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your Parkinson's and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life. Is that relevant to your work  TS  As it turns out  this device kind of comes in handy  because I don't have to have the fine motor skills to do  that I can operate slides  which is more of a mental process. I'm looking at it and making decisions  It needs more red  it needs more blue  it needs a different shape. And so I make these creative decisions and can execute them in a much  much simpler way. I mean  I've got the symptoms. I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years  but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms. In my case  my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also. I'm left handed  and so I draw. All my creations really start on small drawings  which I have thousands of  and it's my way of just thinking. I draw with a simple pencil  and at first  the Parkinson's was really upsetting  because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still. JH  So you're not a gatekeeper for these forces. You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces. You think of yourself as the servant. TS  Nature is    well  it's a godsend. It just has so much in it. And I think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature  humans are of the universe. The universe is in our mind  and our minds are in the universe. And we are expressions of the universe  basically. As humans  ultimately being part of the universe  we're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe. And to interface with it  with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do  giving them pigment and paint just like an artist  it's a good ally. It's a terrific studio assistant. JH  Well  I love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand  some sort of more elemental force gets revealed  and that's the beauty here. Tom  thank you so much. It's been really  really great. TS  Thank you  John.,nan,201002,6.31439678284,438290,TED in the Field,2009-05-05,20090505
