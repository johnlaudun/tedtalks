      "[\"Thank you so much  Chris. And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice  I'm extremely grateful. I have been blown away by this conference  and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night. And I say that sincerely  partly because  Mock sob  I need that. Put yourselves in my position. I flew on Air Force Two for eight years. Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane  I'll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that's been like for me. It's a true story    every bit of this is true. Soon after Tipper and I left the     Mock sob  White House    we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have    miles east of Nashville. Driving ourselves. I know it sounds like a little thing to you  but    I looked in the rear view mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me. There was no motorcade back there. You've heard of phantom limb pain  This was a rented Ford Taurus. It was dinnertime  and we started looking for a place to eat. We were on I   . We got to Exit      Lebanon  Tennessee. We got off the exit  we found a Shoney's restaurant. Low cost family restaurant chain  for those of you who don't know it. We went in and sat down at the booth  and the waitress came over  made a big commotion over Tipper. She took our order  and then went to the couple in the booth next to us  and she lowered her voice so much  I had to really strain to hear what she was saying. And she said  Yes  that's former Vice President Al Gore and his wife  Tipper.  And the man said   He's come down a long way  hasn't he   There's been kind of a series of epiphanies. The very next day  continuing the totally true story  I got on a G V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria  in the city of Lagos  on the topic of energy. And I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville. And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you  Tipper and I were driving ourselves  Shoney's  low cost family restaurant chain  what the man said    they laughed. I gave my speech  then went back out to the airport to fly back home. I fell asleep on the plane until  during the middle of the night  we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling. I woke up  they opened the door  I went out to get some fresh air  and I looked  and there was a man running across the runway. And he was waving a piece of paper  and he was yelling   Call Washington  Call Washington   And I thought to myself  in the middle of the night  in the middle of the Atlantic  what in the world could be wrong in Washington  Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things. But what it turned out to be  was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech  and it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America. It was printed in Monterey  I checked. And the story began   Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday   quote  'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low cost family restaurant'      'named Shoney's  and we are running it ourselves.'  Before I could get back to U.S. soil  David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on    one of them had me in a big white chef's hat  Tipper was saying   One more burger with fries   Three days later  I got a nice  long  handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton  saying   Congratulations on the new restaurant  Al   We like to celebrate each other's successes in life. I was going to talk about information ecology. But I was thinking that  since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED  that maybe I could talk about that another time. Chris Anderson  It's a deal  Al Gore  I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on  What can you do about the climate crisis  I want to start with a couple of    I'm going to show some new images  and I'm going to recapitulate just four or five. Now  the slide show. I update the slide show every time I give it. I add new images  because I learn more about it every time I give it. It's like beach combing  you know  Every time the tide comes in and out  you find some more shells. Just in the last two days  we got the new temperature records in January. This is just for the United States of America. Historical average for Januarys is    degrees  last month was   .  degrees. Now  I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment    I'm kidding. But these are the recapitulation slides  and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do. But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these. First of all  this is where we're projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming  under business as usual. Efficiency in end use electricity and end use of all energy is the low hanging fruit. Efficiency and conservation    it's not a cost  it's a profit. The sign is wrong. It's not negative  it's positive. These are investments that pay for themselves. But they are also very effective in deflecting our path. Cars and trucks    I talked about that in the slideshow  but I want you to put it in perspective. It's an easy  visible target of concern    and it should be    but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks. Cars and trucks are very significant  and we have the lowest standards in the world. And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle. Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks. Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference. And with what Vinod  and John Doerr and others  many of you here    there are a lot of people directly involved in this    this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it. Carbon Capture and Sequestration    that's what CCS stands for    is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe. Not quite there yet. OK. Now  what can you do  Reduce emissions in your home. Most of these expenditures are also profitable. Insulation  better design. Buy green electricity where you can. I mentioned automobiles    buy a hybrid. Use light rail. Figure out some of the other options that are much better. It's important. Be a green consumer. You have choices with everything you buy  between things that have a harsh effect  or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis. Consider this  Make a decision to live a carbon neutral life. Those of you who are good at branding  I'd love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people. It is easier than you think. It really is. A lot of us in here have made that decision  and it is really pretty easy. It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make  and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced. And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net. There is a carbon calculator. Participant Productions convened    with my active involvement    the leading software writers in the world  on this arcane science of carbon calculation  to construct a consumer friendly carbon calculator. You can very precisely calculate what your CO  emissions are  and then you will be given options to reduce. And by the time the movie comes out in May  this will be updated to  .   and we will have click through purchases of offsets. Next  consider making your business carbon neutral. Again  some of us have done that  and it's not as hard as you think. Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations  whether you are from the technology  or entertainment  or design and architecture community. Invest sustainably. Majora mentioned this. Listen  if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance  don't ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management. Over time  people do what you pay them to do. And if they judge how much they're going to get paid on your capital that they've invested  based on the short term returns  you're going to get short term decisions. A lot more to be said about that. Become a catalyst of change. Teach others  learn about it  talk about it. The movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago  except it's a lot more entertaining. And it comes out in May. Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it. Consider sending somebody to Nashville. Pick well. And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow    re purposed  with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach  and it's not just the slides  it's what they mean. And it's how they link together. And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it en masse  in communities all across the country  and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week  to keep it right on the cutting edge. Working with Larry Lessig  it will be  somewhere in that process  posted with tools and limited use copyrights  so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way. Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm's length from politics  It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican  that I'm trying to convince you to be a Democrat. We need Republicans as well. This used to be a bipartisan issue  and I know that in this group it really is. Become politically active. Make our democracy work the way it's supposed to work. Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions    global warming pollution    and trading it. Here's why  as long as the United States is out of the world system  it's not a closed system. Once it becomes a closed system  with U.S. participation  then everybody who's on a board of directors    how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation  Once it's a closed system  you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided. The market will work to solve this problem    if we can accomplish this. Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring. We have to change the minds of the American people. Because presently  the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done. And in our modern country  the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did. It's now repetition of short  hot button     second     second television ads. We have to buy a lot of those ads. Let's re brand global warming  as many of you have suggested. I like  climate crisis  instead of  climate collapse   but again  those of you who are good at branding  I need your help on this. Somebody said the test we're facing now  a scientist told me  is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination. That's really true. I said the other night  and I'll repeat now  this is not a political issue. Again  the Republicans here    this shouldn't be partisan. You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do. This is an opportunity. Not just this  but connected to the ideas that are here  to bring more coherence to them. We are one. Thank you very much  I appreciate it.\", \"Hello voice mail  my old friend. I've called for tech support again. I ignored my boss's warning. I called on a Monday morning. Now it's evening  and my dinner first grew cold  and then grew mold. I'm still on hold. I'm listening to the sounds of silence. I don't think you understand. I think your phone lines are unmanned. I punched every touch tone I was told  but I've still spent    hours on hold. It's not enough your software crashed my Mac  and it constantly hangs and bombs    it erased my ROMs  Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence. In my dreams I fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys. Say your motorcycle crashes. Blood comes gushing from your gashes. With your fading strength  you call       and you pray for a trained MD. But you get me. And you listen to the sounds of silence. Thank you. Good evening and welcome to   Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist.  When I was offered the Times column six years ago  the deal was like this  you'll be sent the coolest  hottest  slickest new gadgets. Every week  it'll arrive at your door. You get to try them out  play with them  evaluate them until the novelty wears out  before you have to send them back  and you'll get paid for it. You can think about it  if you want. So  I've always been a technology nut  and I absolutely love it. The job  though  came with one small downside  and that is  they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column. And what I've noticed is    first of all  you get an incredible amount of email. If you ever are feeling lonely  get a New York Times column  because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails. And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration. People are feeling like things    Ok  I just had an alarm come up on my screen. Lucky you can't see it. People are feeling overwhelmed. They're feeling like it's too much technology  too fast. It may be good technology  but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure. There's not enough help. There's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use. One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support  and within    hours  there were     messages from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website  from users saying    Me too  and here's my tale of woe.  I call it  software rage.  And man  let me tell you  whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will    Oh  how did that get up there  Just kidding. Ok  so why is the problem accelerating  And part of the problem is  ironically  because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use. I'll show you what I mean. This is what the computer interface used to look like  DOS. Over the years  it's gotten easier to use. This is the original Mac operating system. Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette. And the entire operating system    this is the good part    the entire operating system fit in     k. You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in     k  So the irony is  that as these things became easier to use  a less technical  broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time. I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center for a day. The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to. And the calls that    you know how they say   Your call may be recorded for quality assurance   Uh uh. Your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a CD. Which they do. And I have a copy. It's in your gift bag. No  no. With your voices on it  So  some of the stories are just so classic  and yet so understandable. A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking. Making a squeaking noise. And the technician said   Well  ma'am  what do you mean your mouse is squeaking   She says   All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder  the faster I move it across the screen.  And the technician's like   Ma'am  you've got the mouse up against the screen   She goes   Well  the message said  'Click here to continue.'  Well  if you like that one    how much time have we got  Another one  a guy called    this is absolutely true    his computer had crashed  and he told the technician he couldn't restart it  no matter how many times he typed    .  And the technician said   What  Why are you typing      He said   The message says  'Error Type   .'  So  we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users. But why is the technical overload crisis  the complexity crisis  accelerating now  In the hardware world  it's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller  smaller  smaller. So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier  but our fingers are essentially staying the same size. So it gets to be more and more of a challenge. Software is subject to another primal force  the mandate to release more and more versions. When you buy a piece of software  it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar  where you own it. It's more like joining a club  where you pay dues every year  and every year  they say   We've added more features  and we'll sell it to you for    .  I know one guy who's spent        just on Photoshop over the years. And software companies make    percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades. I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox    which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times  you eventually ruin it. I mean  Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in  you know  the Eisenhower administration. But what's the alternative  Microsoft actually did this experiment. They said   Well  wait a minute. Everyone complains that we're adding so many features. Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor  Simple  pure  does not do web pages  is not a database.  And it came out  and it was called Microsoft Write. And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment  because it died. It tanked. No one ever bought it. I call this the Sport Utility Principle. People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power  right  They don't need the database and the website  but they're like   Well  I'll upgrade  because  I might  you know  I might need that someday.  So the problem is  as you add more features  where are they going to go  Where are you going to stick them  You only have so many design tools. You can do buttons  you can do sliders  pop up menus  sub menus. But if you're not careful about how you choose  you wind up with this. This is an un retouched    this is not a joke    un retouched photo of Microsoft Word  the copy that you have  with all the toolbars open. You've obviously never opened all the toolbars  but all you have to type in is this little  teeny window down here. And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices  where there are so many features and options  you have to do two dimensions  you know  a vertical and a horizontal. You guys all complain about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically. The off switch is in there somewhere. I'm telling you    it's there. Part of the art of designing a simple  good interface  is knowing when to use which one of these features. So  here is the log off dialogue box for Windows     . There are only four choices  so why are they in a pop up menu  It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices. They could have put them all out in view. Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box. Thank you    yes  I designed the dialogue box. No  no. Already  we can see that Apple and Microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design. Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be  let's break it down  let's just make it more steps. There are these  wizards  everywhere. And you know  there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall. If they continue at this pace  there's absolutely no telling where they might wind up.  Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard   Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard.  Ok  I'll bite. Let's click  Next  to continue. From the drop down menu  choose the first letter you want to type. Ok. So there is a limit that we don't want to cross. So what is the answer  How do you pack in all these features in a simple  intelligent way  I believe in consistency  when possible  real world equivalents  trash can folder  when possible  label things  mostly. But I beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all  which is intelligence. Now what do I mean by that  I'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent  but it's better. If you are buying something on the web  you're supposed to put in your address  and you're supposed to choose what country you're from  ok  There are     countries in the world. We like to think of the Internet as a global village. I'm sorry  it's not one yet. It's mainly like  the United States  Europe  and Japan. So why is  United States  in the  U s  You have to scroll  like  seven screensful to get to it. Now  it would be inconsistent to put  United States  first  but it would be intelligent. This one's been touched on before  but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC by clicking a button called  Start   Here's another pet one of mine  you have a printer. Most of the time  you want to print one copy of your document  in page order  on that printer. So why in God's name do you see this every time you print  It's like a     shuttle cockpit. And one of the buttons at the bottom  you'll notice  is not  Print.  Now  I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity. Palm is also  especially in the old days  wonderful about this. I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '  s  and after the talk  I met one of the employees. He says   Nice talk.  And I said   Thank you. What do you do here   He said   I'm a tap counter.  I'm like   You're a what   He goes   Well Jeff Hawkins  the CEO  says  'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus  it's too long  and it has to be redesigned.' So I'm the tap counter.  So  I'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter. This is Microsoft Word. Ok  when you want to create a new blank document in Word    it could happen. You go up to the  File  menu and you choose  New.  Now  what happens when you choose  New   Do you get a new blank document  You do not. On the opposite side of the monitor  a task bar appears  and somewhere in those links    by the way  not at the top    somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document. Ok  so that is a company not counting taps. You know  I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ... Yes  I do. The Bill Gates song  I've been a geek forever and I wrote the very first DOS. I put my software and IBM together  I got profit and they got the loss. I write the code that makes the whole world run. I'm getting royalties from everyone. Sometimes it's garbage  but the press is snowed. You buy the box  I'll sell the code. Every software company is doing Microsoft's R D. You can't keep a good idea down these days. Even Windows is a hack. We're kind of based loosely on the Mac. So it's big  so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go. I'm not doing this for praise. I write the code that fits the world today. Big mediocrity in every way. We've entered planet domination mode. You'll have no choice  you'll buy my code. I am Bill Gates and I write the code. But actually  I believe there are really two Microsofts. There's the old one  responsible for Windows and Office. They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh  but they can't. They're locked in  because so many add ons and other company stuff locks into the old      chassis. But there's also a new Microsoft  that's really doing good  simple interface designs. I liked the Media Center PC. I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch. The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market  but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed. But let's put it this way  would you pay     a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone  and stops working when you leave your area code  So  the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse. So is there any hope  The screens are getting smaller  people are illuminating  putting manuals in the boxes  things are coming out at a faster pace. It's funny    when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in       after    years away  it was the MacWorld Expo    he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans  and he sort of did this. The crowd went wild  but I had just seen    I'm like  where have I seen this before  I had just seen the movie  Evita     with Madonna  and I'm like  you know what  I've got to do one about Steve Jobs. It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange. When I try to explain why I'm back  after telling the press Apple's future is black. You won't believe me. All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named Woz. You try rhyming with garage  Don't cry for me  Cupertino. The truth is  I never left you. I know the ropes now  know what the tricks are. I made a fortune over at Pixar. Don't cry for me  Cupertino. I've still got the drive and vision. I still wear sandals in any weather. It's just that these days  they're Gucci leather. Thank you. So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty. And the truth is  for years I was a little depressed  because Americans obviously did not value it  because the Mac had three percent market share  Windows had    percent market share    people did not think it was worth putting a price on it. So I was a little depressed. And then I heard Al Gore's talk  and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed. But it turns out I was wrong  right  Because the iPod came out  and it violated every bit of common wisdom. Other products cost less  other products had more features  they had voice recorders and FM transmitters. The other products were backed by Microsoft  with an open standard  not Apple's propriety standard. But the iPod won    this is the one they wanted. The lesson was  simplicity sells. And there are signs that the industry is getting the message. This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance. The Sonos thing    it's catching on. I've got just a couple examples. Physically  a really cool  elegant thinking coming along lately. When you have a digital camera  how do you get the pictures back to your computer  Well  you either haul around a USB cable  or you buy a card reader and haul that around. Either one  you're going to lose. What I do is  I take out the memory card  and I fold it in half  revealing USB contacts. I just stick it in the computer  offload the pictures  put it right back in the camera. I never have to lose anything. Here's another example. Chris  you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug  Chris Anderson  Oh yeah. DP  Hold that and don't let go. You might've seen this  this is Apple's new laptop. This the power cord. It hooks on like this. And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives  or one of your children. You walk along    and I'm about to pull this onto the floor. I don't care. It's a loaner. Here we go. Whoa  It's magnetic    it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor. In my very last example    I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software. And I'll just    you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous. Speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly  period. Like  I get hundreds of them a day  period. And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down  period. I also use this feature called voice macros  period. Correct  dissuade.  Not  just.  Ok  this is not an ideal situation  because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff. The point is  I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word  and having it write out a much longer thing. So if somebody sends me a fan letter  I'll say   Thanks for that.   Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...  And conversely  if somebody sends me hate mail    which happens daily    I say   Piss off.   I admire your frankness ...  So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone. So the point is    this is a really interesting story. This is version eight of this software  and do you know what they put in version eight  No new features. It's never happened before in software  The company put no new features. They just said   We'll make this software work right.  Right  Because for years  people had bought this software  tried it out       percent accuracy was all they got  which means one in    words is wrong    and they'd put it in their drawer. And the company got sick of that  so they said   This version  we're not going to do anything  but make sure it's darned accurate.  And so that's what they did. This cult of doing things right is starting to spread. So  my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology  remember  if it doesn't work  it's not necessarily you  ok  It could be the design of the thing you're using. Be aware in life of good design and bad design. And if you're among the people who create this stuff  Easy is hard. Pre sweat the details for your audience. Count the taps. Remember  the hard part is not deciding what features to add  it's deciding what to leave out. And best of all  your motivation is  simplicity sells. CA  Bravo. DP  Thank you very much. CA  Hear  hear \", \"I'm going to take you on a journey very quickly. To explain the wish  I'm going to have to take you somewhere where many people haven't been  and that's around the world. When I was about    years old  Kate Stohr and myself started an organization to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work  not only about responding to natural disasters  but involved in systemic issues. We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce  innovative  sustainable design can really make a difference in people's lives. So I started my life as an architect  or training as an architect  and I was always interested in socially responsible design  and how you can really make an impact. But when I went to architecture school  it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family. Many architects seemed to think that when you design  you design a jewel  and it's a jewel that you try and crave for  whereas I felt that when you design  you either improve or you create a detriment to the community in which you're designing. So you're not just doing a building for the residents or for the people who are going to use it  but for the community as a whole. And in       we started by responding to the issue of the housing crisis for returning refugees in Kosovo. And I didn't know what I was doing    like I said  mid   s    and I'm the Internet generation  so we started a website. We put a call out there  and to my surprise  in a couple of months  we had hundreds of entries from around the world. That led to a number of prototypes being built and really experimenting with some ideas. Two years later we started doing a project on developing mobile health clinics in sub Saharan Africa  responding to the HIV AIDS pandemic. That led to     entries from    countries. We also have designers from around the world that participate. And we had an exhibit of work that followed that.      was the tipping point for us. We started responding to natural disasters and getting involved in Iran  in Bam  also following up on our work in Africa. Working within the United States    most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner. But I live in Bozeman  Montana    go up to the north plains on the reservations  or go down to Alabama or Mississippi  pre Katrina  and I could have shown you places that have far worse conditions than many developing countries that I've been to. So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere  and also  I will go into some more projects.       Mother Nature kicked our ass. I think we can pretty much assume that      was a horrific year when it comes to natural disasters. And because of the Internet  and because of connections to blogs and so forth  within literally hours of the tsunami  we were already raising funds  getting involved  working with people on the ground. We run from a couple of laptops  and in the first couple of days  I had       emails from people needing help. So we began to get involved in projects there  and I'll talk about some others. And then of course  this year we've been responding to Katrina  as well as following up on our reconstruction work. So this is a brief overview. In       I really couldn't manage the number of people who wanted to help  or the number of requests that I was getting. It was all coming into my laptop and cell phone. So we decided to embrace an open source model of business    so that anyone  anywhere in the world  could start a local chapter  and they can get involved in local problems. Because I believe there is no such thing as Utopia. All problems are local. All solutions are local. So that means  you know  somebody who's based in Mississippi knows more about Mississippi than I do. So what happened is  we used Meetup and all these other Internet tools  and we ended up having    chapters starting up  thousands of architects in     countries. So the bullet point    sorry  I never do a suit  so I knew that I was going to take this off. OK  because I'm going to do it very quick. This isn't just about nonprofit. What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on  of socially responsible designers who really believe that this world has got a lot smaller  and that we have the opportunity    not the responsibility  but the opportunity    to really get involved in making change. I'm adding that to my time. So what you don't know is  we've got these thousands of designers working around the world  connected basically by a website  and we have a staff of three. The fact that nobody told us we couldn't do it  we did it. And so there's something to be said about na vet . So seven years later  we've developed so that we've got advocacy  instigation and implementation. We advocate for good design  not only through student workshops and lectures and public forums  op eds  we have a book on humanitarian work  but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy. We can talk about FEMA  but that's another talk. Instigation  developing ideas with communities and NGOs  doing open source design competitions. Referring  matchmaking with communities. And then implementing    actually going out there and doing the work  because when you invent  it's never a reality until it's built. So it's really important that if we're designing and trying to create change  we build that change. So here's a select number of projects. Kosovo. This is Kosovo in '  . We did an open design competition  like I said. It led to a whole variety of ideas. And this wasn't about emergency shelter  but transitional shelter that would last five to    years  that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in  and that they would rebuild their own home. This wasn't imposing an architecture on a community  this was giving them the tools and the space to allow them to rebuild and regrow the way they want to. We had from the sublime to the ridiculous  but they worked. This is an inflatable hemp house. It was built  it works. This is a shipping container. Built and works. And a whole variety of ideas that not only dealt with architectural building  but also the issues of governance  and the idea of creating communities through complex networks. So we've engaged not just designers  but also a whole variety of technology based professionals. Using rubble from destroyed homes to create new homes. Using straw bale construction  creating heat walls. And then something remarkable happened in '  . We went to Africa originally to look at the housing issue. Within three days  we realized the problem was not housing  it was the growing pandemic of HIV AIDS. And it wasn't doctors telling us this  it was actual villagers that we were staying with. And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk        kilometers to see doctors  you get the doctors to the people. And we started engaging the medical community  and you know  we thought we were real bright sparks     We've come up with this great idea  mobile health clinics  widely distributed throughout sub Saharan Africa.  And the medical community there said   We've said this for the last decade. We know this. We just don't know how to show this.  So in a way  we had taken pre existing needs and shown solutions. And so again  we had a whole variety of ideas that came in. This one I personally love  because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions  but about raising awareness. This is a kenaf clinic. You get seed and you grow it in a plot of land  and it grows    feet in a month. And on the fourth week  the doctors come and they mow out an area  put a tensile structure on the top  and when the doctors have finished treating and seeing patients and villagers  you cut down the clinic and you eat it. It's an eat your own clinic. So it's dealing with the fact that if you have AIDS  you also need to have nutrition rates  and the idea of nutrition is as important as getting antiretrovirals out there. So you know  this is a serious solution. This one I love. The idea is it's not just a clinic  it's a community center. This looked at setting up trade routes and economic engines within the community  so it can be a self sustaining project. Every one of these projects is sustainable. That's not because I'm a tree hugging green person. It's because when you live on four dollars a day  you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable. You have to know where your energy is coming from  you have to know where your resource is coming from  and you have to keep the maintenance down. So this is about getting an economic engine  and then at night  it turns into a movie theater. So it's not an AIDS clinic. It's a community center. So you can see ideas. And these ideas developed into prototypes  and they were eventually built. And currently  as of this year  there are clinics rolling out in Nigeria and Kenya. From that  we also developed Siyathemba. The community came to us and said   The problem is that the girls don't have education.  And we're working in an area where young women between the ages of    and    have a    percent HIV AIDS rate. And that's not because they're promiscuous  it's because there's no knowledge. And so we decided to look at the idea of sports  and create a youth sports center that doubled as an HIV AIDS outreach center  and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors. So that there would be a very slow way of developing confidence in health care. And we picked nine finalists  and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region  and then the community picked their design. They said  this is our design  because it's not only about engaging a community  it's about empowering a community  and about getting them to be a part of the rebuilding process. So  the winning design is here. And then  of course  we actually go and work with the community and the clients. So this is the designer. He's out there working with the first ever women's soccer team in KwaZulu Natal  Siyathemba. And they can tell it better. Video  Well  my name is Cee Cee Mkhonza. I work at the Africa Centre  I'm an IT user consultant. I'm also the national football player for South Africa  Banyana Banyana. And I also play in the Vodacom League  for the team called Tembisa  which has now changed to Siyathemba. This is our home ground. Cameron Sinclair  I'm going to show that later because I'm running out of time. I can see Chris looking at me slyly. This was a connection  just a meeting with somebody who wanted to develop Africa's first telemedicine center  in Tanzania. And we met  literally  a couple of months ago. We've already developed a design. The team is over there  working in partnership. This was a matchmaking  thanks to a couple of TEDsters    Sun  Microsystems   Cheryl Heller and Andrew Zolli  who connected me with this amazing African woman. And we start construction in June  and it will be opened by TEDGlobal. So when you come to TEDGlobal  you can check it out. But what we're known probably most for is dealing with disasters and development  and we've been involved in a lot of issues  such as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina. This is a     dollar shelter that can be easily assembled. This is a community designed community center. And what that means is we actually live and work with the community  and they're part of the design process. The kids actually get involved in mapping out where the community center should be. And then eventually  the community  through skills training  end up building the building with us. Here is another school. This is what the UN gave these guys for six months       plastic tarps. This was in August. This was the replacement  that's supposed to last for two years. When the rain comes down  you can't hear a thing  and in the summer  it's about     degrees inside. So we said  if the rain's coming down  let's get fresh water. So every one of our schools has a rainwater collection system. Very low cost  three classrooms and rainwater collection is       dollars. This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta. It's built by the parents of the kids. The kids are out there on site  building the buildings. And it opened a couple of weeks ago  and there's     kids that are now using the schools. So  disaster hits home. We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that  but we don't see the good stories. Here is a community that got together  and they said  no  to waiting. They formed a partnership  a diverse partnership of players  to actually map out East Biloxi  to figure out who's getting involved. We've had over       volunteers rebuilding  rehabbing homes. Figuring out what FEMA regulations are  not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild. Working with residents  getting them out of their homes  so they don't get ill. This is what they're cleaning up on their own. Designing housing. This house is going in in a couple of weeks. This is a rehabbed home  done in four days. This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker. She's    years old. This is what FEMA gave her.     bucks  happened two days ago. We put together  very quickly  a washroom. It's built  it's running and she just started a business today  where she's washing other people's clothes. These are the Calhouns. They're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last    years. That was their home  and these are the photographs they took. And we're helping  working with them to create a new building. Projects we've done. Projects we've been a part of  support. Why don't aid agencies do this  This is the UN tent. This is the new UN tent  just introduced this year. Quick to assemble. It's got a flap    that's the invention. It took    years to design this and get it implemented in the field. I was    years old. There's a problem here. Luckily  we're not alone. There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors around the world that are getting involved in humanitarian work. More hemp houses    it's a theme in Japan  apparently. I'm not sure what they're smoking. This is a Grip Clip  designed by somebody who said   All you need is some way to attach membrane structures to physical support beams.  This guy designed for NASA  is now doing housing. I'm going to whip through this quickly  because I know I've got only a couple of minutes. So this is all done in the last two years. I showed you something that took    years to do. And this is just a selection of things that were built in the last couple of years. From Brazil to India  Mexico  Alabama  China  Israel  Palestine  Vietnam. The average age of a designer who gets involved in this project is       that's how old I am. So it's a young    I just have to stop here  because Arup is in the room  and this is the best designed toilet in the world. If you're ever  ever in India  go use this toilet. Chris Luebkeman will tell you why. I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party. But the future is not going to be the sky scraping cities of New York  but this. And when you look at this  you see crisis. What I see is many  many inventors. One billion people live in abject poverty. We hear about them all the time. Four billion live in growing but fragile economies. One in seven live in unplanned settlements. If we do nothing about the housing crisis that's about to happen  in    years  one in three people will live in an unplanned settlement or a refugee camp. Look left  look right  one of you will be there. How do we improve the living standards of five billion people  With    million solutions. So I wish to develop a community that actively embraces innovative and sustainable design to improve the living conditions for everyone. Chris Anderson  Wait a sec    that's your wish  CS  That's my wish. CA  That's his wish  CS  We started Architecture for Humanity with     dollars and a website. So Chris somehow decided to give me        . So why not this many people  Open source architecture is the way to go. You have a diverse community of participants    and we're not just talking about inventors and designers  but we're talking about the funding model. My role is not as a designer  it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world. And what we need is something that replicates me globally  because I haven't slept in seven years. Secondly  what will this thing be  Designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis  but they don't want some company in the West taking their idea and basically profiting from it. So Creative Commons has developed the Developing Nations license. And what that means is that a designer can    The Siyathemba project I showed was the first ever building to have a Creative Commons license on it. As soon as that is built  anyone in Africa or any developing nation can take the construction documents and replicate it for free. So why not allow designers the opportunity to do this  but still protect their rights here  We want to have a community where you can upload ideas  and those ideas can be tested in an earthquake  in flood  in all sorts of austere environments. The reason that's important is I don't want to wait for the next Katrina to find out if my house works. That's too late  we need to do it now. So doing that globally    and I want this whole thing to work multi lingually. When you look at the face of an architect  most people think a gray haired white guy. I don't see that  I see the face of the world. So I want everyone from all over the planet to be able to be a part of this design and development. The idea of needs based competitions    XPRIZE for the other    percent  if you want to call it that. We also want to look at ways of matchmaking and putting funding partners together  and the idea of integrating manufacturers    fab labs in every country. When I hear about the      laptop and it's going to educate every child    educate every designer in the world. Put one in every favela  every slum settlement. Because you know what  Innovation will happen. And I need to know that. It's called the leap back. We talk about leapfrog technologies. I write with Worldchanging  and the one thing we've been talking about is  I learn more on the ground than I've ever learned here. So let's take those ideas  adapt them  and we can use them. These ideas are supposed to be adaptable  they should have the potential for evolution  they should be developed by every nation in the world and useful for every nation in the world. What will it take  There should be a sheet. I don't have time to read this  because I'm going to be yanked off. CA  Let's just leave it up for a sec. CS  Well  what will it take  You guys are smart. So it's going to take a lot of computing power  because I want the idea that any laptop anywhere in the world can plug into the system and be able to not only participate in developing these designs  but utilize the designs. Also  a process of reviewing the designs. I want every Arup engineer in the world to check and make sure that we're doing stuff that's standing  because those guys are the best in the world. Plug. And so  you know  I want these    I just should note  I have two laptops and one of them is there  and that has      designs on it. If I drop that laptop ... What happens  So it's important to have these proven ideas put up there  easy to use  easy to get ahold of. My mom once said   There's nothing worse than being all mouth and no trousers.  I'm fed up of talking about making change. You only make it by doing it. We've changed FEMA guidelines  we've changed public policy  we've changed international response    based on building things. So for me  it's important that we create a real conduit for innovation  and that it's free innovation. Think of free culture    this is free innovation. Somebody said this a couple of years back. I will give points for those who know it. But I think the man was maybe    years too early. So let's do it. Thank you.\", \"Sergey Brin  I want to discuss a question I know that's been pressing on many of your minds. We spoke to you last several years ago. And before I get started today  since many of you are wondering  I just wanted to get it out of the way. The answer is boxers. Now I hope all of you feel better. Do you know what this might be  Does anyone know what that is  Audience  Yes. SB  What is it  Audience  It's people logging on to Google around the world. SB  Wow  OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it. But this is what helped me see it. This is what we run at the office  that actually runs real time. Here it's slightly logged. But here you can see around the world how people are using Google. And every one of those rising dots represents probably about        searches  or something like that. And they're labeled by color right now  by language. So you can see  here we are in the U.S.  and they're all coming up red. There we are in Monterey    hopefully I can get it right. You can see that Japan is busy at night  right there. We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese. There's a lot of activity in China. There's a lot of activity in India. There's some in the Middle East  the little pockets. And Europe  which is right now in the middle of the day  is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages. Now you can also see  if I turn this around here    hopefully I won't shake the world too much. But you can also see  there are places where there's not so much. Australia  because there just aren't very many people there. And this is something that we should really work on  which is Africa  which is just a few trickles  basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities. But basically  what we've noticed is these queries  which come in at thousands per second  are available everywhere there is power. And pretty much everywhere there is power  there is the Internet. And even in Antarctica    well  at least this time of year    we from time to time will see a query rising up. And if we had it plotted correctly  I think the International Space Station would have it  too. So this is some of the challenge that we have here  is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the    there we go. This is how we have to move the bits around to actually get the people the answers to their questions. You can see that there's a lot of data running around. It has to go all over the world  through fibers  through satellites  through all kinds of connections. And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good. But you can see also  once again    so some places are much more wired than others  and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.  going up over to Asia  Europe in the other direction  and so forth. Now what I would like to do is just to show you what one second of this activity would look like. And if we can switch to slides    all right  here we go. So this is slowed down. This is what one second looks like. And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing  is just making sure that we can keep up with this kind of traffic load. Now  each one of those queries has an interesting life and tale of its own. I mean  it could be somebody's health  it could be somebody's career  something important to them. And it could potentially be something as important as tomato sauce  or in this case  ketchup. So this is a query that we had    I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others. You can see that it got started right here. In the U.S. and Spain  it was popular at the same time. But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S. as it did in Spain. And then from Spain  it went to Italy  and then Germany got excited  and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it. And so I guess the U.S. finally  finally started to like it  too. And I just wanted to play it for you. Anyway  you can all enjoy it for yourselves    hopefully that search will work. As a part of    you know  part of what we want to do to grow our company is to have more searches. And what that means is we want to have more people who are healthy and educated. More animals  if they start doing searches as well. But partly  we want to make the world a better place  and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation  and we're in the process of setting that up. We also have a program already called Google Grants that now serves over     different charities around the world  and these are some of the charities that are on there. And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of. In fact  many of the organizations that are here    the Acumen Fund  I think ApproTEC we have running  I'm not sure if that one's up yet    and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants. They run Google ads  and we just give them the ad credit so they can let organizations know. One of the earlier results that we got    we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village of    Vietnamese girls for their education  and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said  now there have been many  many stories that have come in  because we do have hundreds of charities in there  and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor. Now does anybody know who this is  A ha  Audience  Orkut. SB  Yes  Somebody got it. This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut  Do we have any  Okay  not very many people know about it. I'll explain it in a second. This is one of our engineers. We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves. That's how we churn those products out. Orkut had a vision to create a social network. I know all of you are thinking   Yet another social network.  But it was a dream of his  and we  basically  when people really want to do something  well  we generally let them. So this is what he built. We just released it in a test phase last month  and it's been taking off. This is our VP of Engineering. You can see the red hair  and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there. And these are all of his friends. So this is how    we just deployed it    we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service  and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out. And now we've grown to over         members. And they spread  actually  very quickly  even outside the U.S. You can see  even though the U.S. is still the majority here    though  by the way  search wise  it's only about    percent of our traffic    but it's already going to Japan  and the U.K.  and Europe  and all the rest of the countries. So it's a fun little project. There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these. But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun and see where it goes. And    well  I'll leave you in suspense. Larry  you can explain this one. Larry Page  Thank you  Sergey. So one of the things    both Sergey and I went to a Montessori school  and I think  for some reason  this has been incorporated in Google. And Sergey mentioned Orkut  which is something that  you know  Orkut wanted to do in his time  and we call this    at Google  we've embodied this as  the    percent time   and the idea is  for    percent of your time  if you're working at Google  you can do what you think is the best thing to do. And many  many things at Google have come out of that  such as Orkut and also Google News. And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this. Mendel  who was supposed to be teaching high school students  actually  you know  discovered the laws of genetics    as a hobby  basically. So many  many useful things come out of this. And News  which I just mentioned  was started by a researcher. And he just    he    after       he got really interested in the news. And he said   Why don't I look at the news better   And so he started clustering it by category  and then he started using it  and then his friends started using it. And then  besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom  we made it a Googlette  which is basically a small project at Google. So it'd be like three people  or something like that  and they would try to make a product. And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not. And in News' case  you know  they had a couple of people working on it for a while  and then more and more people started using it  and then we put it out on the Internet  and more and more people started using it. And now it's a real  full blown project with more people on it. And this is how we keep our innovation running. I think usually  as companies get bigger  they find it really hard to have small  innovative projects. And we had this problem  too  for a while  and we said   Oh  we really need a new concept.  You know  the Googlettes    that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not  but we hope it will  and if we do enough of them  some of them will really work and turn out  such as News. But then we had a problem because then we had over     projects. And I don't know about all of you  but I have trouble keeping     things in my head at once. And we found that if we just wrote all of them down and ordered them    and these are kind of made up. Don't really pay attention to them. For example  the  Buy Iceland  was from a media article. We would never do such a crazy thing  but    in any case  we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them  that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be. And this was kind of a surprise to me  but we found that as long as you keep the     things in your head  which you did by writing them down  that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do and where to put your resources. And so that's basically what we've done since we instituted that a few years ago  and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative and still stay reasonably well organized. The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important  and so naturally  people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities. I just wanted to highlight a couple of things that are new  or you might not know about. And the top thing  actually  is the Deskbar. So this is a new    how many of you use the Google Toolbar  Raise your hands. How many of you use the Deskbar  All right  see  You guys should try it out. But if you go to our site and search for  Deskbar   you'll get this. And the idea is  instead of a toolbar  it's just present all the time on your screen on the bottom  and you can do searches really easily. And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar. Thank you  Sergey. This is another example of a project that somebody at Google was really passionate about  and they just  they got going  and it's really  really a great product  and really taking off. Google Answers is something we started  which is really cool  which lets you    for five to     dollars  you can type a question in  and then there's a pool of researchers that go out and research it for you  and it's guaranteed and all that  and you can get actually very good answers to things without spending all that time yourself. Froogle lets you search shopping information  and Blogger lets you publish things. But all of these    well  these were all sort of innovative things that we did that    you know  we try many  many different things in our company. We also like to innovate in our physical space  and we noticed in meetings  you know  you have to wait a long time for projectors to turn on and off  and they're noisy  so people shut them off. And we didn't like that  so we actually  in maybe a couple of weeks  we built these little enclosures that enclosed the projectors  and so we can leave them on all the time and they're completely silent. And as a result  we were able to build some software that also lets us manage a meeting  so when you walk into a meeting room now  it lists all the meetings that are happening  you can very easily take notes  and they just get emailed automatically to all the people that were present in the meeting. And as we become more of a global company  we find these things really affect us    you know  can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room  And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference. We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings  and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should. And so we found it was pretty helpful to have laundry machines  for our younger employees especially  and ... we also allow dogs and things like that  and we've had  I think  a really fun culture at our company  which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing. This is actually our  cult picture.  I just wanted to show quickly. We had this on our website for a while  but we found that after we put it on our website  we didn't get any job applications anymore. But anyway  every year we've taken the whole company on a ski trip. A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other  and informally. And I think we've done a good job encouraging that. It makes it a really fun place to work. Along with our logos  too  which I think really embody our culture when we change things. In the early days  we were actually advised we should never change our logo because we should establish our brand  you know  because  you know  you'd never want to change your logo. You want it to be consistent. And we said   Well  that doesn't sound so much fun. Why don't we try changing it every day   One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now is we have this thing called AdSense  and this is a little bit foreshadowing    this is from before Dean dropped out. But the idea is  like  on a newspaper  for example  we show you relevant ads. And this is hard to read  but this says  Battle for New Hampshire  Howard Dean for President     articles on Howard Dean. And these ads are generated automatically    like in this case  on the Washington Post    from the content on the site. And so we use our over         advertisers and millions of advertisements  so we pick the one that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at  much as we do on search. So the idea is we can make advertising useful  not just annoying  right  And the nice thing about this  we have a self serve program  and many thousands of websites have signed up  and this let's them really make money. And I    you know  there's a number of people I met    I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party  and he said   You know  I wasn't making any money. I just put this thing on my site and I'm making        dollars a month. And  you know  thank you. I don't have to do my other job now.  And I think this is really important for us  because it makes the Internet work better. It makes content get better  it makes searching work better  when people can really make their livelihood from producing great content. So this session is supposed to be about the future  so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it. And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search  you really have to be smart. Because you can type  you know  any kind of thing into Google  and you expect an answer back  right  But finding things is tricky  and so you really want intelligence. And in fact  the ultimate search engine would be smart. It would be artificial intelligence. And so that's something we work on  and we even have some people who are excited enough and crazy enough to work on it now  and that's really their goal. So we always hope that Google will be smart  but we're always surprised when other people think that it is. And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this. This is a blog from Iraq  and it's not really what I'm going to talk about  but I just wanted to show you an example. Maybe  Sergey  you can highlight this. So we decided    actually  the highlight's right there. Oh  thank you. So   related searches   right there. You can't see it that well  but we decided we should put in this feature into our AdSense ads  called  related searches.  And so we'd say  you know   Did you mean 'search for'     what is this  in this case   Saddam Hussein   because this blog is about Iraq    and you know  in addition to the ads  and we thought this would be a great idea. And so there is this blog of a young person who was kind of depressed  and he said   You know  I'm sleeping a lot.  He was just kind of writing about his life. And our algorithms    not a person  of course  but our algorithms  our computers    read his blog and decided that the related search was   I am bored.  And he read this  and he thought a person had decided that he was boring  and it was very unfortunate  and he said   You know  what are these  you know  bastards at Google doing  Why don't they like my blog   And so then we read his blog  which was getting    you know  sort of going from bad to worse  and we said the related search was   Retards.  And then  you know  he got even more mad  and he wrote    like  started swearing and so on. And then we produced  You suck.  And finally  it ended with  Kiss my ass.  And so basically  he thought he was dealing with something smart  and of course  you know  we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out  and it didn't quite work  and we don't have this feature anymore. So with that  maybe I can switch back to the world. I wanted to end just by saying that there's a couple things that really make me excited to be involved with Google  and one of those is that we're able to make money largely through advertising  and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that was that we're able to serve everyone in the world without worrying about  you know  places that don't have as much money. So we don't have to worry about our products being sold  for example  for less money in places that are poor  and then they get re imported into the U.S.    for example  with the drug industry. And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model because everyone in the world has access to our search  and I think that's a tremendous  tremendous benefit. The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility to provide people the right information  and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine    that we should provide very objective information. And so in our search results  we never accept payment for our search results. We accept payment for advertising  and we mark it as such. And that's unlike many of our competitors. And I think decisions we're able to make like that have a tremendous impact on the world  and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google. So thank you.\", \"What you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure  wind and temperature readings that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in     . The musicians played off a three dimensional graph of weather data like this. Every single bead  every single colored band  represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note. I find weather extremely fascinating. Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us. So I use sculpture and music to make it  not just visible  but also tactile and audible. All of my work begins very simple. I extract information from a specific environment using very low tech data collecting devices    generally anything I can find in the hardware store. I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet    satellite images  weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys. That's both historical as well as real data. And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here. These clipboards are filled with numbers. And from all of these numbers  I start with only two or three variables. That begins my translation process. My translation medium is a very simple basket. A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements. When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements  I can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form. I use natural reed  because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that I cannot fully control. That means that it is the numbers that control the form  not me. What I come up with are forms like these. These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data. Every colored bead  every colored string  represents a weather element. And together  these elements  not only construct the form  but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two dimensional graph. When you step closer  you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers. The vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day. So all the way around  you have a    hour timeline. But it's also used to assign a temperature range. On that grid  I can then weave the high tide readings  water temperature  air temperature and Moon phases. I also translate weather data into musical scores. And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it. So all of these scores are made up of weather data. Every single color  dot  every single line  is a weather element. And together  these variables construct a score. I use these scores to collaborate with musicians. This is the      Trio performing one of my pieces at the Milwaukee Art Museum. Meanwhile  I use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this  that function still in the sense of being a three dimensional weather visualization  but now they're embedding the visual matrix of the musical score  so it can actually be read as a musical score. What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art  versus science. This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it. You place it in an art museum  it becomes a sculpture. You place it in a science museum  it becomes a three dimensional visualization of data. You place it in a music hall  it all of a sudden becomes a musical score. And I really like that  because the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music. The other reason why I really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science. And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science. So for me  that was my way into it. Thank you.\"]\n"
