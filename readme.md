# TED Talks as Texts

Katherine M. Kinnaird (Smith College) and John Laudun (University of Louisiana at Lafayette)

This rather expansive repository contains data, outputs, documentation, and scripts in support of our work on TED talks as both texts as well as indices of various socio-cultural and historical phenomena.

For those interested only in the original HTML files and/or the CSV which contains the key data parsed from those files, all of that is to be found in the data directory.
