Janine Benyus,"Science writer, innovation consultant, conservationist","A self-proclaimed nature nerd, Janine Benyus' concept of biomimicry has galvanized scientists, architects, designers and engineers into exploring new ways in which nature's successes can inspire humanity. ","Why you should listen
In the world envisioned by science author Janine Benyus, a locust's ability to avoid collision within a roiling cloud of its brethren informs the design of a crash-resistant car; a self-cleaning leaf inspires a new kind of paint, one that dries in a pattern that enables simple rainwater to wash away dirt; and organisms capable of living without water open the way for vaccines that maintain potency even without refrigeration -- a hurdle that can prevent life-saving drugs from reaching disease-torn communities. Most important, these cool tools from nature pull off their tricks while still managing to preserve the environment that sustains them, a life-or-death lesson that humankind is in need of learning. As a champion  of biomimicry, Benyus has become one of the most important voices in a new wave of designers and engineers inspired by nature. Her most recent project, AskNature, explores what happens if we think of nature by function and looks at what organisms can teach us about design.

Marine biologist Tierney Thys has fallen head over heels for a big, goofy fish: the Mola mola, or giant ocean sunfish. In studying the mola -- where they go, what they eat, what eats them -- she's also hunting for clues to the behavior of all life in the open ocean. With their enormous, odd bodies, peaceful habits and lust for jellyfish, these giants can be key to understanding life in the open ocean. Thys and her team are tagging and tracking molas worldwide to learn about how they live, and how climate change may be affecting all ocean life.Thys is a National Geographic Explorer with a passion for marine education. She was also past director of research at the Sea Studios Foundation, a team of scientists and filmmakers that makes media to raise awareness of environmental issues -- including the PBS series Strange Days on Planet Earth  and targeted videos that influence policymakers and businesspeople.

Jacqueline Novogratz,Investor and advocate for moral leadership,"Jacqueline Novogratz works to enable human flourishing. Her organization, Acumen, invests in people, companies and ideas that see capital and networks as means, not ends, to solving the toughest issues of poverty.","Why you should listen
Jacqueline Novogratz writes: ""I want to build a movement in which we define success based on the amount of human energy we release in the world. ""I started my career on Wall Street and soon discovered that markets are efficient, but by themselves they too often overlook or exploit the poor.  So I moved to Rwanda in 1986 to help found the country’s first micro-finance bank.  There I saw the humanitarian ethos of philanthropy, and also how often top-down solutions too often create dependency, the opposite of dignity. Through 30 years of working on solutions to poverty, I have come to redefine it for myself, seeing it not as how much income a person earns, but how free they are to make their own choices and decisions, how much agency they have over their own lives.   Acumen was founded to change the way the world tackles poverty in 2001.  Our mission was simple – to raise philanthropy and  invest it as patient capital – long-term investment in intrepid entrepreneurs willing to go where markets and government had failed the poor.  We enable companies to experiment and fail, never wavering from a commitment to stand with the poor, yet understanding that profitability is necessary for sustainable solutions. We’ve invested more than $110M across South Asia, Africa, Latin America and the US, and have seen entire sectors disrupted and hundreds of millions served.   The work also taught that it was critical to invest in talent. To date, we’ve supported nearly 400 Acumen Fellows across lines of race, class, ethnicity, religion and ideology.  They are a beautiful group, full of vision and grit, and a determination to do what is right, not easy. The group itself enables individual leaders to endure the loneliness that is part of the work. And then we measure what matters rather than just what we can count. Take this all together and you see our mission to do what it takes to build a world in which all of us have the chance to dream and to flourish, not from a place of easy sentimentality but through a commitment to using the tools of capitalism and the attributes of moral leadership to focus on doing what it takes, and no less.

Cheryl Hayashi,Spider silk scientist,"Cheryl Hayashi studies the delicate but terrifically strong silk threads that make up a spider's web, finding startling applications for human use. ","Why you should listen
Biologist Cheryl Hayashi is fascinated with spiders and their silks, and for good reason. Made of a mix of proteins, spider silks come in thousands of variations; there are over 40,000 species of spiders, with many spiders capable of producing half a dozen types. Some silks have the tensile strength of steel -- and often are much tougher -- while remaining light as air and extremely supple. And spiders use their silk in diverse ways: to make their homes and trap their food, to travel, to court and to protect their eggs. In her lab at UC Riverside, Hayashi explores spider silk’s genetic makeup, evolution and unique biomechanics (winning a MacArthur “genius"" grant for it in 2007). Her work blurs the boundary between biology and materials science, looking for the molecular basis of this wondrous material and exploring how humans might learn from it. Hayashi's work may inspire new biomimetic materials for a huge variety of uses, from biodegradable fishing lines and sutures to superstrong ropes and armor cloth.

Four decades on, El Sistema is a nationwide network of youth orchestras, choirs and music centers -- and more than 750,000 young musicians. El Sistema uses music education to help kids from impoverished circumstances achieve their full potential and learn values that favor their growth. Several El Sistema students have gone on to major international careers, including Gustavo Dudamel, music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and the bassist Edicson Ruiz, who at 17 became the youngest musician ever to join the Berlin Philharmonic. These talented musicians are a source of national pride. There is a simple concept behind Abreu's work: for him an orchestra is a place where children learn to listen to each other and to respect one another. This idea has rippled out to 55 countries -- from Afghanistan to Wales. With the 2009 TED Prize, Abreu created the Sistema Fellows Program, an iniative to train music educators passionate about social justice in the United States.

William Li,Cancer researcher,"William Li heads the Angiogenesis Foundation, a nonprofit that is re-conceptualizing global disease fighting.","Why you should listen
Many of society’s most devastating diseases -- cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and Alzheimer’s, to name a few -- share a common denominator: faulty angiogenesis, the body’s growth of new capillary blood vessels. Given excessive or insufficient blood vessel growth, serious health issues arise. While researching under Harvard surgeon Judah Folkman, who pioneered the study of angiogenesis, Li learned how angiogenesis-based medicine helps patients overcome numerous diseases by restoring the balance of blood-vessel growth. Li co-founded the Angiogenesis Foundation in 1994. The foundation’s Project ENABLE -- a global system that integrates patients, medical experts and healthcare professionals -- democratizes the spread and implementation of knowledge about angiogenesis-based medicines, diet and lifestyle. Some 40,000 physicians have been educated on new treatments, ranging from cancer care to wound care, by the foundation’s faculty of medical experts, and they are bringing new, lifesaving and disease-preventing techniques to people around the world.

John Kasaona,Conservationist,John Kasaona is a pioneer of community-based conservation — working with the people who use and live on fragile land to enlist them in protecting it.,"Why you should listen
John Kasaona is a leader in the drive to reinvent conservation in Namibia -- turning poachers into protectors of species. It’s a standard nature-documentary scenario: a pristine animal habitat under constant threat by the people who live there, hunting, camping, setting fires. But John Kasaona knows there is a better way to see this relationship between people and environment. As the assistant director for the Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation (IRDNC) , Kasaona works on ways to improve the lives of rural people in Namibia by involving them in the management of the lands they live on -- and the species that live there with them. Kasanoa's Community-Based Natural Resource Management (CBNRM) program helps rural villages set up communal conservancies, which manage and use local natural resources in a sustainable manner. Essentially, it's about restoring the balance of land and people to that of pre-colonial times, and allowing the people with the most interest in the survival of their environment to have control of it. His work was featured in the recent film Milking the Rhino.The World Wildlife Fund has set up a portal for TEDsters to help in John Kasaona's work. Learn more >>

However, this did teach me an important lesson: You don't have to follow the instructions that come with the box. As an adult, I started my career as a suit-wearing design consultant, designing stuff and strategies for large companies. I then spent a mandatory two years in the Korean Army without killing anybody. Then I began teaching English, which eventually led to a job as an associate professor of industrial design.

Geek-pop maestros John Linnell and John Flansburgh of They Might Be Giants can count inspired adults, inquisitive children, casual pop listeners and underground connoisseurs as equals among their fan base. From their origins in New York City's alternative rock scene in the 1980s to the children's entertainment industry 20 years later, they've been crafting quirky, lore-filled tunes which, despite their capricious instrumentation, remain catchy, effervescent, enduring -- and almost defiantly accessible.As the first major-label band to release an album in exclusively MP3 format, They Might Be Giants are no strangers to offbeat, tech-centric projects. For their album Apollo 18 (named for a nonexistent moon mission), NASA dubbed them the ""Musical Ambassadors"" for International Space Year in 1992 -- while their Dial-A-Song answering machine is the stuff of D.I.Y. music legend. They continue to give away video and audio from live shows, write and distribute new, free songs frequently, and their list of ingenious projects is endless.",non-binary,0,0,12,they (group male)
Naturally 7,A capella ensemble,"The group Naturally 7 practices vocal play — the art of using the human voice to mimic instruments. It's as if a beatboxing troupe decided they could ""-box"" a whole orchestra: flute, horns, drums, guitar — building a vocal wall of sound.","Why you should listen
The men of Naturally 7 can sing like a dream. But what you might not expect from this vocal group is what else they do -- their voices contain multitudes of instruments, from a glorious trumpet to a full drum kit (with a side of turntables). They call it ""vocal play"" -- the art of creating instrumental music with the human voice. It's an evolutionary step beyond beatboxing, which is a solo pursuit -- these seven musicians are a tight orchestra.Naturally 7's sonic range is clear even by reading the member lineup: Roger ""N'glish"" Thomas is a baritone and rapper; Rod Eldridge handles tenor, trumpet and scratching; Warren Thomas brings percussion, guitar and a third tenor. Baritone Dwight Stewart; tenors Jamal Reed and Garfield Buckley (who also plays harmonica); and bass Armand Hutton round out the group.

OK Go,Band,"A wildly creative band of music- and video-makers, OK Go is building a media empire on the back of endless, boundless ingenuity.","Why you should listen
Singer and video director Damian Kulash, Jr. and bassist Tim Nordwind met at summer camp in 1987, and a decade later they formed OK Go. With Dan Konopka as drummer and Andy Ross as guitarist and resident computer programmer, they've built a unique career at the intersection of music, visual art, technology, and science. They're among an emerging class of artists whose 21st-century brand of experimental creativity dissolves the traditional boundaries between disciplines.""When our band started, music and art were actually different things,"" says Kulash. ""Musicians made plastic discs and artists made objects for galleries. Now we all make ones and zeros, so the categorical distinctions don’t make much sense anymore.""OK Go have collaborated with dance companies and tech giants, cosmonauts and Muppets, scientists and entrepreneurs. Their videos have been encoded on strands of actual DNA. They've penned New York Times op-eds and testified before the US Congress, and they were President Obama's selection to perform at his 50th birthday party.OK Go received The Smithsonian American Ingenuity Award for Visual Art, and they've been honored with a Grammy, three MTV Video Music Awards, eleven Cannes Lions, a CLIO, three UK Music Video Awards, two Webby Awards and have had their work presented at The Guggenheim, MoCA, LACMA, The Hirschhorn, The Hammer Museum and Seattle’s Museum of Pop Culture.
